  "title": "TikTok and WeChat: US to ban app downloads in 48 hours - BBC News",
  "url": "https://www.bbc.com//news/technology-54205231",
  "related_topics": "Technology",
  "article_text": "TikTok and WeChat will be banned from US app stores from Sunday, unless President Donald Trump agrees to a last-minute deal. The Department of Commerce said it would bar people in the US from downloading the messaging and video-sharing apps through any app store on any platform. The Trump administration says the companies threaten national security and could pass user data to China. But China and both companies deny this. WeChat will effectively shut down in the US on Sunday, but people will still be able to use TikTok until 12 November, when it could also be fully banned. TikTok said it was \"disappointed\" in the order and disagreed with the commerce department, saying it had already committed to \"unprecedented levels of additional transparency\" in light of the Trump administration's concerns. \"We will continue to challenge the unjust executive order, which was enacted without due process and threatens to deprive the American people and small businesses across the US of a significant platform for both a voice and livelihoods.\" The ban order from the Department of Commerce follows  . It gave US businesses 45 days to stop working with either Chinese company. It is not yet clear whether Mr Trump will approve the deal, but he is expected to review it before the Sunday deadline.  \"At the president's direction, we have taken significant action to combat China's malicious collection of American citizens' personal data,\" the US Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in  . The department acknowledged that the threats posed by WeChat and TikTok were not identical but said that each collected \"vast swathes of data from users, including network activity, location data, and browsing and search histories\". The order means that from Sunday, people will not be able to use WeChat to transfer funds or process payments to or from people in the US. But TikTok users will still be able to use their app virtually as normal, although they will not be able to download new updates.  \"The President has provided until November 12 for the national security concerns posed by TikTok to be resolved,\" the commerce department said. After this point, some technical transactions will be banned on the app and functionality will be affected. Asked about the order on Fox Business Network, Mr Ross said that \"the basic TikTok will stay intact until November 12\", but added that WeChat \"for all practical purposes... will be shut down in the US, but only in the US, as of midnight Monday\".  The Trump administration has repeatedly said the apps are a threat because of their collection of data. Friday's statement from the commerce department said the governing Chinese Communist Party \"has demonstrated the means and motives to use these apps to threaten the national security, foreign policy, and the economy of the US.\" ByteDance has denied that it holds any user data in China, saying it is stored in the US and in Singapore. Tencent, which owns WeChat, has said that messages on its app are private. While TikTok has millions of users in the US, it is not clear how many of WeChat's billion users are based outside China, although it is likely to be a significant number. But the US is not the only country concerned about the companies.  , as well as dozens of other Chinese apps. The government in Delhi said the apps were \"prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order\". The UK Information Commissioner's Office, a privacy watchdog, is also currently investigating the app. Hina Shamsi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Security Project said the order violated First Amendment rights. \"The order also harms the privacy and security of millions of existing TikTok and WeChat users in the United States by blocking software updates, which can fix vulnerabilities and make the apps more secure,\" she said.  TikTok is a video-sharing app. Users can post up to a minute of video and have access to a vast database of songs and filters.  It collects a huge amount of user data - including what videos people watch and comment on, location data, phone model and even how people type. But much of this data collection is similar to other social networks like Facebook. In September the company said it had more than 100 million users. It is thought to have more than 800 million members around the world. WeChat was set up in 2011. It is a multi-purpose app allowing users to send messages, make mobile payments and use local services. It has been described as an \"app for everything\" in China and has more than one billion monthly users.  Like all Chinese social media platforms, WeChat must censor content the government deems illegal. In March,   from as early as 1 January.  But WeChat insists encryption means others cannot \"snoop\" on your messages, and that content such as text, audio and images are not stored on its servers - and are deleted once all intended recipients have read them."

  "title": "Coronavirus in Kenya: From salon to sewer worker - BBC News",
  "url": "https://www.bbc.com//news/world-africa-54162923",
  "related_topics": "Africa",
  "article_text": "To help some of the hundreds of thousands of Kenyans who have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic, the government is paying people to brave open sewers to clean up their neighbourhoods, writes journalist Andrea Dijkstra. Kenyans - dressed in neon vests, masks and gumboots - are standing ankle-deep in a stinking, grey stream which runs between the corrugated iron shacks of Kibera, the largest informal settlement in the capital, Nairobi. They scoop plastic bottles, broken shoes, dirty nappies and human faeces from the open sewer, using their metal spades and rakes. \"It's disgusting work,\" says 33-year-old Abdul Aziz, who is worried that he might get a water-borne disease like cholera because of the insanitary working conditions.  \"However, this is better than staying at home, while being hungry and jobless,\" the father of two children, who lost his job as a private driver at the beginning of the crisis, said. According to the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) more than 1.7 million Kenyans lost their jobs in the first three months of the pandemic. Game parks and lodges are largely empty because of the absence of tourists. Many businesses have gone bankrupt and bars are closed because of an alcohol ban and curfew.  To prevent even bigger problems such as increasing crime and looting, the government launched a large-scale nationwide employment project to provide work to more than 200,000 Kenyans under the age of 35. In Nairobi, it provides work to 55,000 people who are divided into two groups, each working 11 days per month.  Mr Aziz, who lives in Kibera, is happy with the project which he began work on at the end of July. Though the wage of 455 Kenyan shillings ($4.15; Â£3.15) a day is too low, he believes.  He used to earn about $13 a day as a driver. Half of his current income goes towards paying off debts to friends and shops he built up after his dismissal in April.  He hardly has any money left for rent and food. As a result, his family only eats one meal a day.   \"This pandemic has ruined our lives,\" says 23-year-old Sharon Sakase, who is also working on the sewage scheme in Kibera where she lives with her mother, three younger sisters, a younger brother and her own two children in a cramped, corrugated house of only a few square metres. The single mother received a scholarship from a church to study tourism and hospitality.  However, the course was suspended seven months ago and the beauty salon, where she worked doing pedicures to bring in extra money, does not need her as clients have stayed away because of fears about the virus. \"It's very hard to do this dirty job,\" Ms Sakase admits - as a \"flying toilet\" whizzes past plunging into the sewer causing her colleagues nearby to scream. These are plastic bags that residents without toilets use to get rid of human waste. \"Still, I am happy with this work,\" the young mother says. \"I now earn a bit of money to buy food for myself and my family.\"  She has been the sole breadwinner of the eight-person family since her mother lost her job as a housekeeper during the corona crisis.  Kenya's government took drastic measures to curb the spread of the virus, after its first infection was confirmed on 13 March.  A curfew was imposed, corona hotspots like Nairobi and the coastal region were sealed off for three months, the international airport was closed for five months and people had to work from home, which was obviously impossible for many.  As a consequence, 17% of Kenyans are now unable to meet their living expenses while only 47% still have some form of regular earnings, according to a poll conducted by the financial research company FSD Kenya.  To try and ease the burden, the government has adopted economic stimulus measures.  The sales tax and income taxes have been reduced and Kenyans with a monthly wage below $221 receive a 100% tax relief.  However, those working in the informal sector pay no tax anyway, so benefit little from these measures, except that products in official supermarkets may have become slightly cheaper.  \"Many medium and small businesses have gone bankrupt, resulting in a huge number of people losing their jobs. These tax benefits were of little use to them,\" Kenyan economist Kwame Owino says.  The International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave a $739m loan to Kenya to help cushion the impact of Covid-19. However, Mr Owino believes the government has failed to use public money quickly and effectively to cope with the crisis because of other major payment obligations and allegations of corruption.  \"First, civil servants' salaries must be paid and public debts need to be serviced,\" explains Mr Owino, the director of Nairobi-based think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs Kenya. Kenya's public debt had risen to $54.3bn by June this year, or 62% of gross domestic product (GDP), for which the East African country received an official warning from the World Bank last year.  The government is investigating allegations of corruption after it was alleged that a large consignment of donations, including masks and ventilators from Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, had gone missing after it arrived in the country, as well as parts of loans and grants from institutions including the World Bank and IMF.  For those unclogging drains and sewers in Kibera as part of the employment project, the future is worrying. \"Everyone in Kibera is desperately looking for work,\" says 25-year-old Jack Omonoi, who graduated as a web designer two years ago. He was working at an event agency before the pandemic but says everything was cancelled, forcing him to join the sewer project out of sheer desperation. \"Friends saw me going to college and expected me to get a good job. Now they see me shovelling poop out of an open sewer,\" he says while staring despondently at the ground.  \"This situation is extremely frustrating. \"And nobody knows how long this will last.\""

  "url": "https://www.bbc.com//news/entertainment-arts-54202556",
  "related_topics": "Entertainment & Arts",
  "article_text": "Emmy-winning actress Tatiana Maslany has been cast as She-Hulk in the upcoming Disney+ TV series, breathing new life into Stan Lee's 80s comic-book character.  Maslany's acting chops are well-documented - she won her 2016 Emmy for starring in five seasons of BBC America's TV show Orphan Black, as more than a dozen clones of a woman trying to escape her past. This is her first big foray into superhero territory though, introducing fans to a character not everyone will be familiar with.  She-Hulk's human alter-ego is lawyer Jennifer Walters, who also happens to be the cousin of Bruce Banner, better known as Hulk. Created by Lee and artist John Buscema, she first appeared in The Savage She-Hulk comic in 1980. Marvel's YouTube channel calls Jennifer a \"bad-ass lawyer breaking glass ceilings and a lot more\". But after being shot, a life-saving blood transfusion from Bruce transforms her into a \"giant, green rage monster\". The diluted dose of gamma-filled blood gives her a milder version of Hulkiness, so Jennifer learns to \"keep her calm and her smarts while in Hulk form\", unlike her cousin.  She-Hulk is arguably a more entertaining character than Hulk - Marvel.com says she \"backs up her sensational strength with her savage wit and confidence\", while Hulk is famously toddler-like, typified by  phrases like \"Hulk smash!\". Having calmed her inner green monster, Jennifer moves to New York to work with the Avengers and her friends the Fantastic Four, tackling supervillains and fighting crime in court - rarely returning to her human form. She also finds time for the odd romance, notably with Thor, who presumably wasn't intimidated by her physical prowess. The news was welcomed by Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk in the Avengers films.    The Canadian actress, 34, found an early love of acting, appearing in local productions as a young child and working in professional TV shows while in secondary school, including Canadian children's television series 2030 CE (2002-03).  She went on to appear in Canadian TV series Heartland (2008-10) and Being Erica (2009-11) and also notably played Mary in the BBC miniseries The Nativity (2010). Maslany also got noticed at the Sundance film festival that year, winning the breakout performance prize for the film Grown Up Movie Star, playing Ruby, aged 13, who has to survive life with her rural father after her mother runs away to become an actress.    In 2013, Maslany wrote a blog for the BBC about Orphan Black, where she said playing scenes with clones of herself was \"one of the biggest challenges I've faced as an actor\". \"I look insane when we shoot those scenes because ultimately I'm on an empty set talking and reacting to nothing. It's very much about imagination,\" she wrote. \"At the same time it's a highly technical process because I have to hit certain marks and my eyes have to be focused in the right place in order for the special effects to layer in seamlessly.\"  Such work on set should stand her in good stead for working on a superhero series, which will no doubt involve plenty of green-screen and CGI work. The actress's other work includes a key role as Sister Alice McKeegan in HBO/Sky Atlantic's series Perry Mason, as well as TV series BoJack Horseman in 2015 and a couple of 2013 episodes of Parks and Recreation.   Until now, She-Hulk has never taken off in the same way as Hulk, who has enjoyed his own cartoon series, TV series, and of course various films, most successfully played on the big screen by Ruffalo in the Avengers universe. She had a brief appearance in the cartoon, in 1983 in an episode called Enter: She Hulk, but the character didn't really take off, leaving the main stage at the time to DC's Wonder Woman TV series.  Efforts to include She-Hulk in a Hulk film starring the original TV star Lou Ferringo never materialised, and nor did a She Hulk TV show.  Although a film in 1991 was going to star Brigitte Nielsen in the main role, this also never got past the promotional shots.   There isn't much documentation around as to why She-Hulk didn't make it properly onto either the small or big screen. It could have been down to a lack of financing or simply not enough popularity for the character. But things have changed. The huge success of Marvel's Avengers, and female characters including Captain Marvel, Black Widow and DC's Wonder Woman, has had an impact. There has also been the recent success of Netflix's Marvel series Jessica Jones, first released in 2015. It was cancelled last year after three series, making way for new characters such as She-Hulk.  A second Wonder Woman film starring Gal Gadot is due to be released, along with an upcoming Black Widow film starring Scarlett Johanssen. There is also the possibility of a female Thor film in 2020 called Thor: Love and Thunder. So the way is most definitely being paved for what Disney+ will certainly hope will be great success for She-Hulk, assuming she manages to keep her temper."

  "article_text": "At Chad Jones' feet is a sports bag that contains six boxes, each valued at between about $10,000 and $30,000 a pop.  This inconspicuous holdall, which a few minutes ago was slung over his shoulder on its journey from the boot of his car to our table, is easily worth over six figures. The commodities Jones sells are not antiques or diamonds; they're not fragile or laden with weight. They're not handmade and they're not particularly robust, either. They are highly collectable, artistically created and of an aesthetic born in his hometown of New York City. We're talking trainers - or sneakers as they say in the United States. And yes, they really are that valuable. Jones, a 41-year-old former college basketball player from Brooklyn, also known as Sneaker Galactus,external-link specialises in collecting and selling unique footwear - those of limited production runs or symbolic of rare sporting backstories. He keeps them all in pristine, boxed condition - a prerequisite for any self-regarding sneakerhead - and on racks he picked up from a closing Foot Locker store. It's a lifelong passion that has evolved into his livelihood, a business he has grown from a side hustle in his school days. \"When I was in college, my mother lost her job,\" Jones explains. \"I had a car and my mother was paying for it. She told me she could no longer pay, so I started flipping [my extra pairs] out of the trunk. \"I'd buy a pair of Air Jordan Concord 11s for $150 and sell them for $350. I sold enough to be able to get me through college and pay for the car. So I always knew there was something there.\" It's no coincidence that Jones was so drawn to these shoes, having grown up in 1980s Brooklyn. After all, it was this area of the five boroughs that benefited from some of the most important drivers of the sneaker culture we know today: hip hop, street basketball and Michael Jordan. Arguably the greatest player to ever shoot hoop, Jordan was born in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, just a few miles from Jones' childhood home, although he moved to North Carolina at a young age. Jordan's status in the eyes of 1980s USA was already rarefied thanks to his prowess on the court with the Chicago Bulls, but when almost exactly 35 years ago, on 15 September 1985, Nike released the Air Jordan 1s, it gave the fan on the street a tangible way to bring a little of his prestige to their own person. For many, the Air Jordan 1s are the shoe that kickstarted the global sneaker resale market, an industry recently valued at $6bn (£4.6bn) by Cowen Equity Research and predicted to be worth $30bn (£23bn) by 2030.external-link It is a theory seemingly supported by the eye-watering figures this particular model of trainer has sold for at auctions in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. Boosted by the release of the popular Last Dance Netflix series, which documents Jordan's exploits at the height of his aerial powers, both Sotheby's and Christie's have registered record prices at recent auctions. A pair of game-worn Air Jordan 1s High, replete with an embedded shard of glass from a backboard shattered by a particularly powerful Jordan dunk, sold for a record $615,000 (£468,000) at Christies this August. That merely followed the previous high watermark set by a Sotheby's auction held in May, when another signed pair of Air Jordan 1s netted $560,000 £426,000). The Air Jordan 1s are of particular value. They were they designed by legendary sneaker designer Peter Moore. They reflected Jordan's specific request to feel 'closer to the court' by removing the air bubble from the sole. And they were also famously banned by the NBA within a month of release. This led to a notoriety among fans that quickly turned the sneaker into a sales phenomenon. Nike, ever attuned to a marketing opportunity, exploited the situation with a widely broadcast advertexternal-link that boasted: \"Fortunately, the NBA can't stop you from wearing them.\" Demand was so high that Jordan sneaker muggings and attacks became commonplace in many American cities. A killing over the trainer promoted Sports Illustratedexternal-link to run with a cover story title: \"Your Sneakers or Your Life.\" Jones himself experienced the violent side associated with demand for sneakers when in 2012 - at a New York release of the Nike Kobe 7 models - he was stabbedexternal-link while camping overnight outside the store in a queue. It's an incident he chooses to no longer revisit in interviews. The Air Jordan 1s' release was a seminal moment according to Simon 'Woody' Wood, founder of global trainer magazine Sneaker Freaker,external-link and not just because of the cultural hype. \"One of the beautiful things about the shoe is the quality of the leather,\" he says. \"I have a pair of Jordans here from 1985. The leather is thick as anything. It feels like they just sliced a chunk of cow off and stitched it to the shoe. They're pretty much indestructible.\"  Woody, based in the Australian city of Melbourne, is something of an expert on the subject. Having started the Sneaker Freaker magazine as a cult read and vehicle to get free sneakers from manufacturers in 2002, Woody's business has since ballooned into a website, a merch business, a creative agency and a magazine that's now sold in 40 countries. Most recently he authored a 700-page book called The Ultimate Sneaker; to which nearly forty pages were devoted to Jordans alone. \"I mean really I could've filled the entire book on Jordans,\" he says. \"In terms of investment that might've been a smarter move right now! It's the only brand really based on an athlete. And, he's the Supreme Being, a god around which a whole mystique has been built. \"The Americans love him as a winner, a guy who comes from nowhere and becomes the most famous and wealthy person ever. But physically to watch him jump from, you know, beyond the three point line and sink a basket, he was just so good. And the shoes really locked into that aspect of him.\" The brightness of the star factor associated with the Air Jordan 1s has been key in helping them remain, in a galaxy of standout sneakers, the most coveted for those with money to spend. Especially for \"cashed up guys in their 40s and 50s\" who remember Jordan at his height, Woody believes. Another secret behind the mystique, he suggests, lies in the enduring appeal of their design features. There's the 'wings logo' - inspired by airline badges of the time - the red, white and black colours that echoed Jordan's Chicago Bulls affinity, and 'classic panelling' that help to build the sneaker's 'story'. A story that was given a new chapter in April this year when Dior teamed up with Nike to release a new, co-branded version of the model that retailed for $2,000 (£1,520) a pair. Featured on the cover of Sneaker Freaker, the shoe quickly sold out when a staggering five million people tried to buy the 8,500 pairs released. Online marketplace StockX shows the shoe drawing anything up to $20,000 on its real time price graphs that one would associate more readily with trading stocks. Covid-related economic volatility, it seems, is not a problem in the sneaker resale niche, where profits are not only increasing but markets are expanding. For Jones, his day to day may now be in Fort Lee, New Jersey - where his white-soled sneakers benefit from sidewalks that are \"thankfully cleaner than in New York\" - but his future profits will increasingly be drawn globally. Local knowledge used to be key in sourcing sneaker gems, as boutique stores and little-known outlets across New York City would sell their limited supplies to in-the-know hunters. Though he still refers to his hometown as the \"world Mecca for sneakers\", the bulk of Jones' purchases are made online via a network of other collectors, with sales increasing in hotspots like Asia. It has helped him amass over 1,100 pairs in total, and some of his favourites are in the black sports bag on the floor below. \"This is a PlayStation Air Force 1 anniversary shoe, only 50 pairs in the world. Made in 2009 by Nike and worth around $10,000,\" he says, matter of factly. \"These are Stash Zoom Kobe 1s, made in collaboration with NORT in 2006, They're worth about $20,000.\" Designs associated with players like the tragic figure of Kobe Bryant help to drive prices higher, but ultimately it's the discerning eye of the collector that sets the value: beauty being firmly in the eye of the buyer. It was an appreciation Jones' wife, Adena, struggled to come to terms with when the couple first started dating. Admitting to suffering vertigo from sleeping under the great walls of boxed shoes that lined his apartment, she came to understand their value when her then boyfriend linked his Paypal account to hers. It allowed him to showcase the sale returns of his accumulating assets in real time. \"I quickly realised their power. I saw $8,000 come in from two pairs and I was like: you're right, this is it! I tell people part of our home is paid for by sneakers. This ring, my wedding ring, is paid for by sneakers,\" she says, proudly holding forth her sparkling rock. As co-founder of Another Lane, a new online business run in partnership with Jones that targets aficionados priced out by the recent sneaker boom, Adena is now convinced of what her husband has known since childhood: sneakers are more than just shoes, they are prized symbols of identity. In fact, Jones goes as far to suggest they have political symbolism too. \"Sneakers were originally white because that was the colour of the tennis-playing elites,\" he says. \"People who look like me traditionally served those people, that's why wearing the colour white is so significant in the black community. Wearing clean, white sneakers means you can afford them and you've elevated yourself in society.\" It's a sentiment echoed by Elizabeth Semmelhack, senior curator of Toronto's Bata Shoe Museumexternal-link and author of Out Of The Box: The Rise Of Sneaker Culture. \"Having enough money to step out in a 'fresh', pristine and unscuffed, pair of Nikes became a point of pride, a symbol of rugged individualism whose fashion was hyper-masculine and easily marketed in ways that capitalised on both its American-ness and its exoticism simultaneously,\" Semmelhack says. \"Can sneakers be used in a political way? 100% yes. It's why stepping on someone's prize pair can be deeply offensive.\" Semmelhack sees a through line from the nouveau riche, tennis-court origins of the mid-19th Century sneaker to rapper Jay-Z's affirmation that he would only ever wear a pair of white trainers once to maintain his crisp aesthetic. It's a notion Jones intrinsically understands. \"It's like, yo, that kid, he always got a fresh pair of sneakers on, I wonder what he does? It's like there's this mysteriousness, a question mark: what is this guy really about?\" he says. Thirty-five years on, it seems hang time footwear has lost none of its potency."

  "related_topics": "Football",
  "article_text": "Liverpool have signed midfielder Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich on a four-year deal for £20m. The fee for the Spain international, 29, could eventually rise to £25m with bonuses. \"It's an amazing feeling. I was waiting for this moment for a long time and I am very happy to be here,\" he said. Thiago will wear the number six shirt at Anfield and becomes the club's second summer signing after Greece left-back Kostas Tsimikas. He will be eligible to play against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.   Thiago won La Liga twice with Barcelona before a 2013 move to Bayern, where he won the Bundesliga seven times and the Champions League in August. His arrival at Anfield ends weeks of speculation about whether the Premier League champions would make a stand-out summer signing. The £20m fee will be paid in instalments over the length of the deal, and up to an additional £5m will be paid based on the Reds' success in the Premier League and Champions League as well as any individual awards earned by Thiago. \"Absolutely great - I'm really happy that it finally worked out and we could just do it,\" said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp. \"I know all the people at Bayern wanted to keep him desperately. That's normal and understandable because he played an important role, in the last season as well.  \"He just was ready for a new challenge and he decided for us.\" Thiago added: \"I must adapt to the team as fast as I can in the situation and the context that we are living right now. \"Everything is more compact and we started a little bit later, but still it is football and I think we have to mix all the big things up, all the good things we have. \"I will help the team in a defensive and offensive [way] and also in a mental aspect.\" Klopp said: \"When we spoke about all the players, he respects them all massively. He admires them.  \"We played against him when we played Munich in the Champions League two years ago [Liverpool won 3-1 in the second leg of their last-16 tie after a 0-0 draw at Anfield], so he knows what kind of machine we can be and he wanted to be part of that.\" Meanwhile, Liverpool have targeted another addition in Wolves forward Diogo Jota, who was a surprise omission from his side's Carabao Cup defeat by Stoke on Thursday. After the game, Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo repeatedly refused to state the reason for the Portuguese's absence. Now it has emerged the 23-year-old former Porto and Atletico Madrid player is being targeted by Klopp's side in a deal that could be worth up to £35m. Jota joined Wolves on loan in their 2017-18 Championship-winning campaign, making a £12.8m permanent switch in 2018. He has made 131 appearances, scoring 44 goals, including hat-tricks in last season's Europa League victories against Besiktas and Espanyol. Any deal, which would represent a record transfer sale for Wolves, is likely to see full-back Ki-Jana Hoever move the other way. The 18-year-old Dutchman can play either as a full-back or in central defence and fits Wolves' recent quest to bring in younger players they can develop. The Athletic's Raphael Honigstein on Radio 5 live's Euro League's podcast It [the Thiago deal] is quite cheap considering what you are getting, which is one of the best holding midfielders in the world.  Liverpool fans should consider themselves very lucky because they are picking up an absolute superstar who could probably play in any team in the world. They have plenty of reason to be excited.  When Pep Guardiola went to Bayern, his first signing was Thiago and he said 'it's Thiago or no-one for me'. When Thiago got injured he then went to buy Alonso as a replacement.  Thiago is in the form of his life, the way he played in the Champions League, combining that skill and elegance with winning balls back.  He makes it look effortless. It adds something to that Liverpool midfield, which doesn't quite have that skill-set. The idea is to rotate a lot more. There will be so many games - this will be the shortest, most insane season ever - so to rotate players around is going to be brilliant for a team who play with so much energy.

  "related_topics": "European Football",
  "article_text": " Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale has arrived at Tottenham Hotspur's training ground as he nears a return to the club. Wales international Bale, 31, is expected to rejoin Spurs on loan. He flew into Luton Airport on Friday before travelling to the training ground in Enfield, North London. Bale originally joined Spurs from Southampton in 2007 before moving to the Spanish giants for a then world record £85m in 2013. He has gone on to score more than 100 goals for Real and won four Champions Leagues. \"Until I'm told Bale is a Tottenham player, I still think and feel and respect the fact he's a Real Madrid player,\" said Spurs boss Jose Mourinho. It is also anticipated Real Madrid full-back Sergio Reguilon will complete his transfer to Tottenham on Friday. The 23-year-old Spain international played last season on loan at Sevilla, winning the Europa League. Bale's agent, Jonathan Barnett, told BBC Wales Sport on Wednesday that talks over a move were \"slowly progressing\". Barnett said: \"Gareth is closer to leaving Madrid than at any time in the last seven years. We are still negotiating. We shall see how it goes.\" Spurs boss Jose Mourinho refused to speculate on the discussions, saying: \"He is a Real Madrid player and I don't comment on players from other clubs. I have to respect that. It's better not to speak. \"I tried to sign him for Real Madrid, which was not possible to do during my time there. But the president followed my instinct and my knowledge and the season I left he brought Gareth to the club. It's not a secret, even Gareth knows that.\" In July 2019, Real cancelled a deal for Bale to join Chinese Super League club Jiangsu Suning, and he played 20 times for the Spanish champions last season. Tottenham were beaten 1-0 at home by Everton in their first game of the new Premier League campaign on Sunday."

  "title": "The Nigerian filmmakers risking jail with lesbian movie Ife - BBC News",
  "url": "https://www.bbc.com//news/world-africa-54070446",
  "related_topics": "Africa",
  "article_text": "Two Nigerian filmmakers face the prospect of imprisonment if they ignore the stern warning of the authorities and proceed with the release of a movie about a lesbian relationship.  The dramatic face-off with the regulators - the Nigerian Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB) - is worthy of a film itself.  Producer Pamela Adie and director Uyaiedu Ikpe-Etim are determined that Ife (meaning \"love\" in the Yoruba language) reaches a Nigerian audience, but the NFVCB says it will not be approved as it violates the country's strict laws on homosexuality.  To get around this, the filmmakers are planning a surprise online release to catch the regulators off-guard. The NFVCB, however, is diligently monitoring all digital platforms to prevent the movie from getting out. According to NFVCB boss Adebayo Thomas, Adie and Ikpe-Etim could be jailed for promoting homosexuality in a country where same-sex relationships are forbidden and can carry a 14-year sentence. They are organising a private screening in the commercial capital, Lagos, at the end of the month, for which they believe they do not need to get permission.  Ife will also get an international premiere in Canada in October. Adie said the aim of the film was to show an accurate picture of lesbian and bisexual women in Nigerian movies. If a lesbian woman does appear in a standard Nollywood movie they are often portrayed as being possessed, influenced by bad friends or forced into homosexuality and always needing \"saving\", she told the BBC. \"You rarely see stories about LGBT people, especially about queer women that speak to the realities of our lives.  \"Ife was made to bridge the gap and to get the conversation going in Nigeria.\"  Ife is a story about two women falling in love as they spend three days together. They \"then have their love tested by the realities of being in a same-sex relationship in a country like Nigeria\", according to the publicity for the film.  , then Ife certainly pushes the boundaries of telling the LGBT story by Nigerian movie standards. In one shot, the two protagonists, Ife and Adaora are in bed talking about love and the challenges faced by LGBT people especially within their families. Their conversation forms the spine of the teaser for the film. \"I told my mum first, took her about a week to come to terms with it,\" Ife, played by Uzoamaka Aniunoh, says talking about revealing that she was a lesbian. \"Which is short for a Nigerian mother,\" interjects Adaora, played by Cindy Amadi. \"Is it too soon to say I might be in love with you?\" asks Adaora as they cuddle. \"We are lesbians, this is the perfect time,\" answers Ife.  Homosexuality is an extremely contentious issue in many parts of Africa and Nigeria is no different. It is a highly religious and traditional society and its influential Christian and Muslim organisations oppose homosexuality.  As a consequence, Nigeria is one of 30 countries on the continent where it is criminalised. The legislation outlawing same-sex relationships was passed in 2014 and built on the colonial-era prohibition of sodomy. Police in Nigeria have cracked down on people suspected of homosexuality, forcing most into hiding. The feeling of being sidelined and the need to challenge beliefs that homosexuality is immoral is what inspired director Ikpe-Etim to take on the project. \"Before now, we have been told one-sided stories. What we are doing with this film is normalising the queer experience, we are normalising the LGBT romance.  \"It will begin to erase that shame that LBQ [lesbian, bisexual and queer] women face,\" she told the BBC. The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community in Africa is becoming increasingly vocal and visible, thanks to the internet providing a space for films, talk shows and websites. You may also like to watch: But that has not stopped filmmakers from getting into trouble with authorities. The head of the NFVCB said there was no space for Ife or other homosexual movies in Nigeria, citing the law. \"There's a standing law that prohibits homosexuality, either in practice or in a movie or even in a theatre or on stage. If it's content from Nigeria, it has to be censored,\" Mr Thomas told the BBC. He said that whatever the platform was, \"as long as it's Nigerian content and it's telling a Nigerian story, then we have a right to it\". But there is no plan for large-scale screenings of Ife in Nigerian cinemas or selling the DVD, as the producers want to make it available online as pay-on-demand. But even that will get them into trouble with the regulators.  \"If it did not pass through NFVCB and it is released, the filmmakers will be prosecuted according to the law,\" Mr Thomas said. \"As long as it's Nigerian content, we will pull it down because we have collaborations with Google, YouTube and other key players.\" But that has not deterred the producers and Adie says her team will continue as planned, as they believe they have done nothing wrong and do not plan to seek permission for an online release. This is not the first time an LGBTQ-themed movie has fallen foul of regulators on the continent. Stories of Our Lives, a collection of five short films based on stories of LGBTQ life in Kenya was banned in 2014 for being \"contrary to national norms\".  This was also the fate of Rafiki, Kenya's first film about a lesbian relationship, which went on to be the East African nation's first film to premiere at the Cannes film festival and also receive an Oscar nomination. Inxeba/The Wound, a South African film about a relationship between two men in the context of the Xhosa initiation ritual  Despite the set-backs, some in the LGBTQ community in Africa say they are gradually gaining confidence and acceptance and link it to the increased visibility in films and literature which are encouraging greater tolerance among younger generations.  showed an increase in acceptance of LGBTQ people - though the balance was still tilted against them. Some 60% of Nigerians surveyed said they would not accept a family member who was LGBTQ, but this was significantly lower than the 83% who put themselves in that category in 2017. The need for further change is why people like Ikpe-Etim want to keep telling the stories of the LGBTQ community. \"As a member of an under-represented group, you are constantly at the mercy of people who don't understand what it means to be queer.  \"I knew if I wanted the society to view LGBTQ people in a different light, I had to tell the full story,\" she said."

  "article_text": "Both women’s concerns show how fine the line between art and pornography is and how tricky trying to negotiate it is. Mary Beard’s claim in an interview that the nude is always in danger of being “soft porn for the elite” was met with abusive messages in the article comments and on Twitter. Like Boyce, she discovered that trying to start a discussion on the subject tends to inspire hostility rather than interest. Which is why ArtActivistBarbie, subverting a plastic doll widely vilified by feminists for being a gender stereotype, was a stroke of genius on her creator’s part. “The issue is discussion and starting to view things differently,” says Sarah Williamson. “AAB provides a fun and playful way of doing this and, in doing so, trying to create a world in which there is more equality for women and where they are not just the subject of the male gaze.” In one of ArtActivistBarbie’s most commented-on posts, she poses on the floor of a gallery in front of Manet’s Le Déjeuner sur l’herbe. In the first picture, Barbie is naked like the woman in the picture and her two male companions are fully clothed. But then the set-up is reversed and Barbie appears in her glad rags while the two men are naked. It’s an interesting juxtaposition and one that certainly makes you think.

  "related_topics": "Travel",
  "article_text": "For nearly 900 years, the soaring spires and fortified walls of the hilltop Convent of Christ citadel have stood guard over the sleepy central Portuguese city of Tomar. Built in 1160 as a headquarters of the mysterious Knights Templar Catholic army that served the Pope, this sprawling, Unesco-inscribed Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque stronghold served as a fitting centrepiece of the Templar’s power in Portugal for 400 years. But if you gaze down from the convent’s lofty ramparts and search outside the city walls for a tiny church across the Nabão river, you’ll find one of the world’s most important – if overlooked – Templar sites: the Church of Santa Maria do Olival.  Predating the castle, this seldom-visited Gothic church was built at the behest of crusader and Knight Templar Gualdim Pais to serve as the holy pantheon for the Order of the Knights Templar. In addition to becoming an important site for underground Templar initiation rites over the centuries, the church also holds the remains of some of Portugal’s most famous Knights – including Pais. And because Tomar helped launch Portugal’s 15th-Century maritime expansion, spearheaded by Henry the Navigator (a well-known Knight himself), this unassuming stone church became the spiritual centre of all Portuguese churches built overseas – leading some to declare it the “Vatican” of the Templars. Today, from the five-pointed star above the main entrance to the fact that the church itself is built below ground, this Portuguese National Monument remains coded with Templar symbolism. A labyrinthine system of tunnels is also rumoured to connect the hilltop castle with the church, roughly 1.5km away. These underground tunnels even helped local Templars evade a Moorish siege in 1190. These days, many of the secret chambers that Pais and the Knights used to escape their invaders are still visible in the forests surrounding the hilltop castle. BBC Travel’s Mysteries of the Knights Templar tracks down the secret sites and mysterious ceremonies of what was once one of the most powerful and wealthy organisations in Europe.

  "article_text": "In his book on ancient literacy, Reading and Writing in Babylon, the French assyriologist Dominique Charpin quotes a letter by a scribe called Hulalum that hints at silent reading in a hurry. Apparently, Hulalum switched between “seeing” (ie, silent reading) and “saying/listening” (loud reading), depending on the situation. In his letter, he writes that he cracked open a clay envelope – Mesopotamian tablets came encased inside a thin casing of clay to prevent prying eyes from reading them – thinking it contained a tablet for the king. “I saw that it was written to [someone else] and therefore did not have the king listen to it,” writes Hulalum. Perhaps the ancient scribes, just like us today, enjoyed having two reading modes at their disposal: one fast, convenient, silent and personal; the other slower, noisier, and at times more memorable.

  "url": "https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200917-the-impact-of-banning-alcohol-during-covid-19",
  "related_topics": "Worklife",
  "article_text": "Prohibition’s pitfalls Yet the Liquor Traders’ Association’s Lucky Ntimane – who says that the government has left the hundreds of thousands of people who’ve lost jobs high and dry – believes banning booze full-stop doesn’t address the real issue and that re-education is a more viable and effective long-term solution. “As a country, we are avoidant dealing with the issue of alcohol abuse and its societal harm. This Covid-19 pandemic actually allows us to re-examine our unhealthy relationship with alcohol,” he says. “I’m in a better situation as a tavern owner to be able to drive the message of responsible drinking. I’m able to tell my patron: ‘You now have had enough’.” Jeffrey Miron, an economist at Harvard University, says that alcohol bans often end up causing more problems, especially as they so often drive alcohol use and trade underground. “Underground markets have a bunch of characteristics which we tend not to like: they tend to be violent, they tend to have poor quality control, so one gets more accidental poisoning and overdoses,” he says. “You forgo the opportunity to collect tax revenue. And they tend to be imposed and enforced in racially prejudiced ways.” Miron says that while tax revenue from alcohol is not a huge amount of money in most economies, outlawing the entire industry “has a significant negative effect on the economic outcomes” and can “contribute to bad health outcomes when people lose health insurance because people have lost their jobs, or people are depressed because they’ve lost their jobs”. When it comes to Covid-19, he says restricting activities that spread disease, like people being in indoor restaurants and bars, is a more effective public health measure – and allowing those shops to do takeaway or alcohol-to-go can help offset economic impact. And as far as banning booze to curb violence, Miron says that doesn’t work, either. “In the US case, violence went up” during prohibition, he says, in regard to organised crime and illegal trade on the black market. Why? Because “people resolve underground disputes in markets often with guns rather than with lawyers.” Emily Owens, who studies criminology and economics at the University of California, Irvine, points to the balancing act that many countries try to strike. “Alcohol is something that people enjoy drinking. It’s pleasant. We get utility out of alcohol consumption. But at a certain point, alcohol consumption really is problematic for society.” She believes that higher taxes and making alcohol pricier would allow people who really want to drink the ability to do so legally, but “maybe discourage people on the margin from consuming as much as they might currently choose to”. Whatever the long-term answers are, South Africa’s short-term alcohol ban gave Bongiwe Ndondo, the domestic violence researcher, a glimpse of improvements that could be achieved with greater regulation. “South Africa has got a lot of binge drinking,” she says. “How can we continue to have some form of restrictions in place, but more sustainable than a complete prohibition?” Finding an answer to that question would no doubt serve many nations and communities well – whether it’s during a pandemic, or not."

  "article_text": "Measures to deal with new coronavirus outbreaks are being imposed across Europe. Many involve the reintroduction of restrictions which had been eased following the initial lockdown.   Following fresh outbreaks in July, the French government made face masks compulsory in enclosed public spaces.  The government wants to avoid a new national lockdown, so the new measures have been imposed by local authorities. Face masks   in public in Paris and surrounding areas by anyone aged 11 and over. Hundreds of other municipalities across France have also introduced this rule, including in Toulouse, Nice, Lille and Lyon and some beach resorts. Masks also have to be   The rule applies in offices and factories wherever people are sharing space.   Masks have to be worn by anyone over the age of six on all forms of public transport in Spain and in many other indoor public spaces. Most regions in Spain have made masks obligatory outdoors as well. The new school year has started and Spanish schools are asking children as young as six to wear masks at school.  The ban on large gatherings in Germany has now been extended to the end of the year, so the new Bundesliga football season will also start behind closed doors on Friday. Testing at airports is now compulsory for all travellers arriving from high-risk countries and a minimum fine of 50 euros (Â£46) has been introduced for people failing to wear face coverings in shops or on public transport.  With infections rising again in Italy, authorities ordered closures of all dance halls and nightclubs, including outdoors ones, from 17 August. Face masks must also be worn from 18:00 to 06:00 local time in all public spaces across Italy, where social distancing isn't possible.  Children have gone back to school, after more than six months, despite schools in several regions saying that they are not ready to reopen.  Denmark was one of the first countries in Europe to reopen schools in April.  However, in late August the number of cases started rising sharply.  The government has responded by making face masks compulsory on public transport.  In Copenhagen and surrounding areas, which have seen a spike in cases, bars, restaurants and nightclubs must now shut at 22:00. Private parties, such as weddings, also have to end by the same time and masks must be worn in restaurants, bars and cafes.  The Belgian government has decided not to go ahead with the next phase of reopening places after a rise in infections.  Nightclubs remain closed and no major events, such as festivals, are allowed.  In the capital Brussels, wearing a face mask became compulsory in all public areas on 12 August amid a rise in cases.  Football fans are being let back into stadiums, but only at a fraction of the capacity, separated by empty seats and wearing masks.   In the Netherlands, you can have a maximum of six people visiting your home and they have to be able to stay 1.5m apart. Local authorities can implement their own additional measures. Amsterdam and Rotterdam have both scrapped pilot schemes in which face masks would be compulsory in outdoor public spaces. Children started to return to schools from 17 August. Extra hygiene measures have been put in place, but social distancing will apply to adults only.  As pupils return to school and some workers return to their offices, new restrictions are being put in place from 15 September.  They include the closing of commercial establishments between 20:00 and 23:00 and limiting gatherings to a maximum of 10 people.  Masks are now compulsory in all public indoor spaces and on all public transport in Greece. Schools were due to reopen on Monday. There have also been further local restrictions introduced on some of the Greek islands, and free on-the-spot testing has been offered to people arriving on the mainland from those islands.  Social visits to homes in Ireland, both indoors and outdoors, are limited to six visitors from no more than three households.  Outdoor gatherings are limited to 15 people. People aged over 70 are again being asked to stay at home as much as possible, and workers are being encouraged to work from home if possible. There have also been local lockdowns - the one in County Kildare   into September."

  "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54151691",
  "related_topics": "Entertainment & Arts",
  "article_text": "On 27 February, 2002, Alicia Keys was miserable with the flu. She was also due to attend her first-ever Grammys. That night, she was up for six awards, including song of the year for Fallin', and was due to perform a medley of hits alongside Flamenco dancer Joaquin Cortes. \"I willed myself out of bed,\" she recalls in her autobiography, More Myself. \"I wasn't about to miss my first Grammys, even if my face crashed right down onto the piano keys.\" A shot of vitamin B12 carried her through the ceremony, where Keys scooped five of those six awards, tying Lauryn Hill's record for the most trophies for a female solo artist in a year. The mixture of exhilaration, illness and drowsiness made it feel like she'd \"ascended into outer space\". \"What new artist wins five awards after just one album?\" The whole night \"felt unbelievable to me,\" she adds, \"even otherworldly\". Fast forward to 2020 and Keys was back at the Grammys - this time as host - as Billie Eilish replicated her five-prize success. The teenager, who was born in the year Keys released her debut, seemed uncomfortable with all the acclaim. As the nominees for album of the year were read out, the camera caught her saying, \"please don't be me\". On stage, she confessed to feeling undeserving. Watching from the sideline, Keys knew exactly what she was going through.  \"Oh my God, absolutely,\" she says. \"There you are, with all these accolades and all this celebration - and you don't know exactly what to do with it, or even why was it you. \"It feels almost like it's overkill. You think, 'Spread it around, don't just give [the awards] to me,' you know? I definitely recognise that, I understood that.\" The following morning, Keys called Eilish to offer her support. \"I wanted to congratulate her because I was so happy for her,\" she says, \"because not only does she have a beautiful voice but  she's not trying to fit in to the crowd - and that's such an important thing to see. \"So when I called her I said, 'Don't for one second think that you didn't deserve this. You deserve all of this, and don't forget it.'  \"Because I remember I definitely felt like that for a long time. I thought I didn't deserve what I was receiving, I didn't deserve the greatness that I had inside of me.\"  It's a surprise to learn that Keys ever felt inadequate or unworthy. Her music pulses with strength and messages of emancipation. Even U2's Bono says the star gives off a \"don't eff with me\" energy. But, as she explains in her book, More Myself, songs like Superwoman and Girl On Fire weren't written by someone who had the world figured out. Instead, \"the lyrics were what I needed to hear\".  Keys was miserable, second-guessing her instincts and worried about sustaining her success. Worse still, she let others prey on those fears to make her work harder. By 2006, \"I no longer belonged to myself,\" she writes in the memoir. \"I'd become captive to every request, every demand, every surge of fear that came with even the thought of saying no.\" After breaking down in her dressing room one night in New York, she booked a solo trip to Egypt and escaped. On the first day,   she lost her voice to laryngitis.  Forced to slow down and pay attention to her feelings, she resolved to wrestle back control of her life, \"setting boundaries and making changes for the better\". But change didn't come overnight. Learning to stand up for herself and resisting the urge to please others took years of practice. Keys was also forced to confront aspects of her personality she'd previously suppressed. \"I'm not as comfortable [with] the parts that are very vulnerable or even angry,\" she says.  \"Anger is not an emotion that I'm very in touch with, and I realised that that's because my mother has always had a really big, strong personality. Because of that I've always kind of had to manage her emotions and be the peacekeeper. And so I got used to that.\"  Born Alicia Augello Cook in 1981, Keys was raised in Hell's Kitchen - one of New York's toughest neighbourhoods. Her father left when she was two, forcing the family to scrape by on her mother's meagre salary as a paralegal.  Despite their limited finances, she insisted that her daughter take piano lessons, practising on a battered upright a friend had donated. Keys turned out to be a prodigious talent, both musically and academically. She skipped two years of school, graduated valedictorian from New York's Professional Performing Arts School and signed her first recording contract when she was 15. But those achievements (and the fact she was taller than her older classmates) exaggerated a feeling of otherness. \"I have felt like an outsider,\" she says. \"I think I learned along the way how to fit into multiple circumstances in different places, different spaces, different people. But I always felt like I was from another planet or another time, and I didn't really belong here.\" \"Like I was somehow dropped in this era and I was like, 'Wait, how did I get here?'\" Keys is certainly an old soul. One of the reasons the music community embraced her debut album so readily was her ability to splice the sophisticated soul of the 70s to the street sounds of hip-hop. But that sensibility failed to impress her first record label, Columbia, who wanted to market her as a clean-cut teen idol. The piano prodigy was told to make her music \"more radio-friendly\" and \"less piano-driven\". With depressing inevitability, she was also told  to lose weight and show more cleavage. Incensed, she fought her way out of the contract, even managing to retain the rights to her master tapes, which she brought to Clive Davis's J Records.  Songs In A Minor, which contained many of the songs Columbia had dismissed as sounding \"like a demo\", was eventually released in 2001 and went on to sell 12 million copies. Keys characterises the fight for control as her \"first act of artistic defiance\" - and it demonstrated a self-confidence that was lacking in other areas of her life. But Keys says the one thing she's never been willing to compromise on is her music. \"That's always been my outlet, that's always been my safe space. The ability to write and discuss what I'm feeling and share that in an intimate way - that's definitely always been my truth.\"  Around the same time that Keys was writing her autobiography, she started work on her seventh album. Inevitably, as she explored her identity on paper, the music started to reflect the opening up of her personality. So alongside the chilled-out ballads and motivational lyrics, you get to see her \"crazy, freaked-out, seeing red, yelling and screaming\" side, on a track like Truth Without Love (sung, she says, with a \"lip curl\"); or her confused, self-sabotaging side, on the country-tinged Gramercy Park. That's why the record is simply called Alicia - \"because I know for a fact that this is the first time that I'm fully meeting myself and getting to know all of me.\" The album was originally due out in March - but Covid put a stop to that, as well as a mammoth world tour that was due to take up the rest of her year. The pause gave Keys time to tinker with the album -  but it also gave some of the songs an unexpected resonance.  Good Job, for instance, was written last year as a tribute to her mum and the other \"honest and selfless\" people whose everyday sacrifices went unnoticed.  \"Every time I played it, people would have tears in their eyes - even before all of this,\" she recalls. In the midst of the pandemic, however, the song became an anthem for the doctors, carers, teachers and delivery drivers on the frontline. \"I would have never imagined in a million years that it would be so relevant,\" she says, \"but the spirit of the song is the same: Those who need to hear that they're doing a good job are often the ones who don't [get] celebrated.\" On the other hand, the heart-breaking Perfect Way To Die was written with one eye on the future.  Telling the story of a grieving mother whose child was murdered, it alludes to the deaths of Michael Brown, who was killed by police in Missouri in 2014, and Sandra Bland, who died in a jail cell in 2015 after Texas police stopped her for a minor traffic violation. After the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the song assumed a new urgency. Keys performed it at June's BET Awards in a deserted New York City, surrounded by murals of Floyd, Taylor and Bland. At the end of the song, she knelt on the street, which had been stencilled with names of dozens of black men and women whose lives have been lost to racism and police brutality. \"I always knew it would be relevant, unfortunately, the blatant disrespect of black lives,\" says Keys. \"So in a sad way I did actually know that whenever [the song] came out, it would be right on time. \"I didn't know that I would feel so moved to bring it out during this time, as this whole planet is recognising this tremendous injustice, no matter where we're from.  \"I don't think there's been that consciousness before. Many people have just said, 'too bad that's going on but that's not me -  without really recognising how everybody does participate in the outcome of what's acceptable and not acceptable.  \"And that's actually part of what I believe is going to transform it and make it completely unacceptable. I look forward to that happening.\" Already a powerful song, Perfect Way To Die becomes even more intense on the album, where it arrives immediately after one of Keys' most care-free moments - a duet with neo-soul singer Jill Scott. But as the two songs segue, rain starts to fall and the mood darkens. \"I really thought about that a lot,\" says Keys. \"I wanted to make sure that it was a big transition in a way that shocks you.\" It's an artistic move she might have rejected in the past - but with a new-found confidence, Keys is ready to rock the boat. \"In a lot of ways I feel like I'm just getting started,\" she says. \"You haven't even seen me yet!\"  Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

  "title": "Alligator on gas snaps up Ig Nobel prize - BBC News",
  "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-54197198",
  "related_topics": "Science & Environment",
  "article_text": "Have you heard the one about the alligator that performed the party trick of breathing in helium so it could talk in a funny voice? It's not that hilarious but then you'd be careful never to smile at a crocodilian. Stephan Reber and colleagues performed the experiment to try to understand how alligators might communicate. It was a serious piece of research but its slightly comedic aspects have just won the team an Ig Nobel Prize. Ten such awards were handed out on Thursday by the science humour magazine Annals of Improbable Research. The annual Igs are intended as a bit of a spoof on the more sober Nobel science prizes. Other 2020 winners included the team that devised a method to identify narcissists by examining their eyebrows; and the group that wanted to see what happened when earthworms were vibrated at high frequency. All this kind of stuff sounds daft, but when you dig a little deeper you realise much of the research lauded by the Ig Nobels is actually intended to tackle real-world problems and gets published in peer-reviewed, scholarly journals.  Dr Reber told BBC News he was honoured to receive the Ig.  His team's study had attempted to show that crocodilians and other reptiles could advertise their body size through their vocalisations - something that mammals and birds can do when they call out. \"The resonances in your vocal tract sound lower overall if you're larger because it's a larger space in which the air can vibrate. We didn't know if reptiles actually had resonances. Frogs, amphibians, don't for example. So we needed a proof of concept that crocodilians actually have resonances,\" he explained. This was achieved by putting an alligator in an enclosed tank that could be filled alternately with normal air and a supply of oxygen and helium (heliox). The vibrations of the vocal tissues don't change but the noise the animals are able to make will, because the speed of sound is different in the different gas mixtures.  The analysis of the frequency spectrum confirmed alligators' body size does indeed correlate with the resonances they produce. \"Although whether the animals can pick up on these cues, I haven't tested,\" the Lund University, Sweden, researcher said. This is the 30th year the Ig Nobels have been presented. Their usual home is the Sanders Theatre at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US; and the event is always a riotous affair that involves lots of paper plane throwing and a small girl who shouts \"boring\" at anyone who talks for too long.  But the Covid-19 crisis forced this year's ceremony online. Even so, some traditions were maintained, like the involvement of real Nobel Laureates. Dr Reber's team was presented with its Ig by Andre Geim, the UK-based researcher who won the Physics Nobel in 2010 for his work on graphene. The Prof is something of a superstar having also won an Ig earlier in his career for levitating frogs.   Here's a full list of the 2020 Ig Nobel winners. Each winning team was given a cash prize - of a 10 trillion dollar bill from Zimbabwe. For Acoustics: Stephan Reber, Takeshi Nishimura, Judith Janisch, Mark Robertson, and Tecumseh Fitch, for inducing a female Chinese alligator to bellow in an airtight chamber filled with helium-enriched air. Psychology: Miranda Giacomin and Nicholas Rule, for devising a method to identify narcissists by examining their eyebrows.  Peace: The governments of India and Pakistan, for having their diplomats surreptitiously ring each other's doorbells in the middle of the night, and then run away before anyone had a chance to answer the door. Physics: Ivan Maksymov and Andriy Pototsky, for determining, experimentally, what happens to the shape of a living earthworm when one vibrates the earthworm at high frequency. Economics: Christopher Watkins, Juan David Leongómez, Jeanne Bovet, Agnieszka Żelaźniewicz, Max Korbmacher, Marco Antônio Corrêa Varella, Ana Maria Fernandez, Danielle Wagstaff, and Samuela Bolgan, for trying to quantify the relationship between different countries' national income inequality and the average amount of mouth-to-mouth kissing. Management: Xi Guang-An, Mo Tian-Xiang, Yang Kang-Sheng, Yang Guang-Sheng, and Ling Xian Si - five professional hitmen in Guangxi, China, who subcontracted a murder one to the other with none of them in the end actually carrying out the crime. Entomology: Richard Vetter, for collecting evidence that many entomologists (scientists who study insects) are afraid of spiders, which are not insects. Medicine: Nienke Vulink, Damiaan Denys, and Arnoud van Loon, for diagnosing a long-unrecognized medical condition: Misophonia, the distress at hearing other people make chewing sounds. Medical Education: Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Boris Johnson of the United Kingdom, Narendra Modi of India, Andrés Manuel López Obrador of Mexico, Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus, Donald Trump of the USA, Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Vladimir Putin of Russia, and Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow of Turkmenistan, for using the Covid-19 viral pandemic to teach the world that politicians can have a more immediate effect on life and death than scientists and doctors can.  Materials Science: Metin Eren, Michelle Bebber, James Norris, Alyssa Perrone, Ashley Rutkoski, Michael Wilson, and Mary Ann Raghanti, for showing that knives manufactured from frozen human faeces do not work well.

  "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-53998711",
  "related_topics": "Business",
  "article_text": "Sean Heavey recognised his photo the moment he saw it on Stranger Things.  “God, that storm looks familiar,” he said, as he and his son watched the hit Netflix show. When he watched a documentary about the making of the series, he became certain.  “They saved it off of Google, added a foreground to it and used it as a piece of concept art,” Mr Heavey says.  No-one else had photographed this supercell thunderstorm; no other cars drove down the road that day, to chase it across the Montana prairie.   He called the four panoramic shots he had stitched together The Mothership.  “I should have got credit and paid for it,” says Mr Heavey.   He tried to contact Netflix, but the company told him, “You can't copyright Mother Nature.” His case stalled. Chasing storms is no hobby for Mr Heavey.  Getting that perfect shot costs him thousands of dollars in petrol every year. He braves “golf ball-sized hail”, winds raging over 100mph and rescues stranded people.  He complained on social media and his remarks were read by executives at Pixsy, a firm that helps photographers fight copyright infringement. They contacted Mr Heavey and, eager for the help, he agreed to work with them.   Pixsy appointed Mr Heavey a lawyer, David Deal, and together they found six more occasions where Netflix used The Mothership. Netflix settled the lawsuit in December 2018, according to records seen by the BBC.  The company did not respond to a request for comment. In the UK, if convicted in a magistrates' court of copyright infringement you could face six months in jail or a fine of up to £50,000. Conviction in a Crown Court could carry a penalty of 10 years in jail and/or an unlimited fine.  In the United States, fines can reach $150,000 (£115,000) every time a picture is used the wrong way.  When a case is successful, firms like Pixsy collect 50% of the settlement or award at court.  “They all settle,” says Mr Deal, of copyright cases.  He says this is because the law is clear cut.   More Technology of Business  Pixsy is one of a handful of companies that has developed image look-up technology to monitor and pursue copyright infringement on behalf of photographers.  Its service incorporates artificial intelligence that has been trained to match an artist's work with instances on the web.  It can also identify alterations including crops, re-colouring and layers added or removed. The moment a picture is taken, as long as it was taken by a human being, it is protected by intellectual property laws.   More than 2.5 billion images are stolen daily, according to a 2019 study by Copytrack, a copyright search and enforcement firm. Many of these are found using a technology called reverse image look-up.  This works like Bing or Google, but rather than using words to find related information, the search matches pictures. Some of the free image search engines, like TinEye and Google, will also verify when and where a picture was taken and if it was altered.  Copyright infringement firms use this same technology but will also hire a lawyer and cover the costs of filing a lawsuit.    Pixsy is close to filing its 100,000th case of copyright infringement in five years. It currently monitors close to 100 million images. “Keeping on top of all of this is impossible for any individual. For us, we see this as a very big problem for photo owners and photo creators,” says Kain Jones, the chief executive of Pixsy.   He argues that licence fees are “bread and butter” to many photographers.  “That's where we come in, where we're happy to be the bad guy,” Mr Jones says.  However, Chip Stewart, a media law professor at Texas Christian University in the US, says that because so many of these cases settle out of court, the system is ripe for abuse.   Recently, a student of his used an image from a Creative Commons website for the school newspaper. Though she did not have to pay a licence fee, she did not follow the requirements listed under the photo, to credit the photographer or add a link to his website.   Through Pixsy, the photographer found the student and issued her a letter asking for a $750 licence fee.  “The 20-year-old student was pretty terrified getting a demand letter and she said, 'I thought we did everything right.' And I said, 'I can tell you right now that you didn't, but it's an easy mistake to make.'\" A search through public records revealed that the photographer had filed more than 40 similar cases that year. They negotiated him down and agreed to pay a fee of $500.  Fighting over such a small fee in court would cost a fortune.  “It is not worth two years and tens of thousands of dollars of litigation on the off-chance we might win. And if you lose, you might pay the lawyer fees. That's what these copyright troll firms realise - is that the system is so heavily weighted in favour of copyright owners,” says Mr Stewart.  In response Pixsy said: \"One of our key criteria [for Pixsy to work on the case] is that it is a commercial usage of the photo. In your example of the private university, they are a revenue-generating organisation and are not exempt from copyright law. A case would be with the university itself and not an individual student.\" Some actors have given those who pursue copyright claims a bad reputation. One particularly prolific lawyer, Richard Liebowitz, has been dubbed a \"copyright troll\", having filed about 1,280 cases in the Southern District of New York since 2017. As well as the sheer number of cases he's filed, his behaviour has not endeared him to the courts and a judge recently fined him $103,500 for misconduct, which included \"repeated violations of court orders and outright dishonesty, sometimes under oath\".  Joe Naylor is the chief executive of ImageRights International, another company like Pixsy that uses technology to help photographers pursue copyright infringement.  He says lawyers like Liebowitz are bad for the industry. “It does profound and fundamental damage to copyright holders who are trying to protect their rights,” says Mr Naylor.  Pursuing licence fees must always be the photographer’s choice. However, Mr Naylor says his company does not recommend photographers go after non-profit blogs or student newspapers. While he understands this happens, he says ImageRights International is more interested in defending professional photographers like Sean Heavey.  “There's literally no word that can be spoken to me that makes me more angry than photographers being called trolls for trying to pursue their own claims.”  Sean Heavey still sees instances of The Mothership used without permission.  If people credit the picture he “lets it slide”, especially if there is no profit involved. Recently he found a lady who was selling prints of the photo claiming it was her picture. Another Instagram influencer often claims The Mothership is his.  He says: “Being able to stand up and know your rights - it's good, because it keeps food on the table for my family.”"

  "article_text": "Question: What do the following have in common? Rubber ducks. A disco ball. A laptop. Numerous sex toys. A prop zombie hand. A ballpoint pen that turned out to be a family heirloom. A sock stuffed with baggies of cocaine and a weighing scale. Answer: They were all fished from Amsterdam’s murky-blue canals in the past year.  It sounds perverse, but our main goal is to end our company  If fishing on Amsterdam’s canals is about anything nowadays, it’s about eco-tourism and environmental awareness more than angling. There’s a curious logic to this, but according to Eva de Jong, operations manager at Plastic Whale, the world’s first professional plastic fishing company, there is a huge payoff. “It sounds perverse, but our main goal is to end our company,” said de Jong, by way of introduction to the peculiar business. “We want to reach a point where there is no more plastic or rubbish left in Amsterdam’s canals for us to fish out. That is our hope.”  Afloat on the Prinsengracht canal, our slightly unlikely fishing boat was puttering south towards the Amsterdam most visitors know. The one with the houseboats and pancake restaurants. The one with the bascule bridges, chained-up bicycles and gabled houses, including the most famous, where teenage diarist Anne Frank and her family hid from the Nazis during World War Two. But there are two Amsterdams, and I was here to see the other, less appealing one. The one where fishing nets are used to scoop crisp packets out of swirling canals. The one where plastic bottles are extricated from tangled birds’ nests, and beer cans that bob beneath otherwise picturesque bridges are cleared up day after day. This type of tourism – essentially, tidying up after other visitors and locals – is not for everyone, but the long-term cost to the environment of not doing it is greater. And, in Amsterdam, at least, Plastic Whale is helping to turn the tide. You may also be interested in:• The Dutch islands of tomorrow• The Netherlands’ war against water• Why are the Dutch so tall?  Started in 2011, Plastic Whale now has a fleet of 11 boats, with a two-vessel franchise operating in Rotterdam. Each electric-powered cruiser is made from recycled material fished from the canals, and each one is an individual work of art, supported by a Dutch sponsor and bedecked with mosaics made from fished-out beer bottle tops. The soft murmur of the engine sounded as we trawled our nets through the water, collecting the morning’s first haul of litter. What emerged in my overloaded net were cigarette packets, disposable coffee cups and a battered Styrofoam carton. In de Jong’s, there was an entire box’s worth of drowning beer bottles. “You certainly see Amsterdam from a different perspective this way,” said boat skipper Berend Hilberts, manoeuvring the vessel towards another clogged corner of rubbish. “All this is brand new. And I should know. I cleaned this same spot yesterday.”  Isn’t that demoralising, I asked? “Not at all,” Hilberts replied, matter-of-factly. “We’re flushing out the whole system and over time we’re seeing less rubbish and fewer plastic bottles than when the company began. That’s really motivating, in fact.” Hard evidence, however, points to a different reality. Globally, a new report by the University of Leeds estimates that 1.3 billion tonnes of plastic is destined for our land and seas by 2040. Even if drastic action is taken to shift human behaviour, the study reports, the likelihood is an extra 710 million tonnes of plastic soup will still drip-feed into our environment over the next 20 years. That’s enough to cover the area of the UK 1.5 times, and a potent environmental catastrophe on an almost unimaginable scale. Such statistics – and there are many more like them – are rightly terrifying. In real terms today, the size of the problem is easier to fathom. It is estimated that a staggering 10% of all our plastic – as much as 2.41 million tonnes – ends up in our oceans. World Cleanup Day (19 September) and International Coastal Cleanup Day (21 September) help draw fleeting recognition to the issue every year, but the extent of the problem is relentless. You only need to Google such environmental paradoxes as the Great Pacific garbage patch (a vortex of plastic soup in the North Pacific) or the Western Garbage Patch, off the coast of Japan, to see the overwhelming reality of the plastic problem.  None of this is lost on Plastic Whale’s founder and CEO Marius Smit, whose personal tale became a route into the wider story of plastic soup itself. His lightbulb moment came when seeing the scale of the world’s plastic problem first-hand while travelling in South-East Asia. All too often he discovered beaches obscured by bottles. “I was standing on one particular beach in Indonesian Borneo just after a storm,” he told me, a few days after my plastic fishing trip. “The entire beach was engulfed by plastic waste. So much so that you couldn’t see the sand. It shocked me to my core.” Now an anti-plastic crusader, Smit returned to Amsterdam, vowing to do something about the problem in his own backyard. Fishing in the celebrated canals has been part of the city’s fabric for centuries, with locals staking out spots on the IJ river and North Sea Canal with lures and lines to haul in the likes of zander, bream and perch. Smit, a fearless sort with a background in marketing, saw something in this legacy.  I need to make something of this, to make the impossible possible  \"I looked for inspiration and I was struck by JFK’s historic speech in 1961 about sending a man on the Moon,” he said. “At the time, I remember saying to myself, ‘I need to make something of this, to make the impossible possible’.” Soon after, Smit came to this conclusion: he needed to manufacture a vessel from recycled waste from Amsterdam’s canals, and he’d be well on his way. He’d never driven a boat, let alone built one, but was convinced that that was what he had to do. “Once the idea floated,” he added, “there was no going back.” That first year was a minor triumph, acting as a clarion call to friends and locals. And his plastic fishing concept has grown every year since. Last year, Plastic Whale fished more than 40,500 plastic bottles out of Amsterdam’s canals, with more than 18,000 tourists helping out. To the extent, in fact, that it is now less an eccentric pilgrimage and more a badge of honour. Part of the success has been down to how the company is helping educate government stakeholders and businesses on a wider scale that waste has palpable economic value. Starbucks, in fact, was one of the first companies to go fishing with Smit and co, and events have since been run in London, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Ghent to test the concept in international waters.  Certainly, the plastic soup pulled from the water doesn’t give a sense of the products that can be manufactured from the recycled polyethylene terephthalate, or PET. Once taken to a processing factory, it can be refined into valuable PET spin-offs and all kinds of creative possibilities: currently, flakes, granules, fibres and felt are innovatively repurposed as sharply designed seats, tables, boardroom desks and barnacle-shaped light fixtures. It is old, unwanted junk that feels very new. Beyond cleaning-up the Netherlands, Plastic Whale has other ambitious goals. The next project – to launch in October – is tackling plastic soup in Ghana, a place Smit fixed on after seeing a heart-stirring photo of a beach swamped by rubbish. The proposal? To roll out seven waste management centres to treat the problem right at the source. “Ultimately, we’re a social enterprise with a mission and we need to keep educating people that plastic waste has economic value,” Smit concluded. “First it was the Netherlands, now it’s Ghana. And who knows where’ll be next. Only then can we change people’s relationship with plastic.”  In Smit’s world, fishermen – and dreamers – are always welcome.

  "related_topics": "UK Politics",
  "article_text": "Former minister and leading Brexiteer Liam Fox remains in the running to be the new head of the World Trade Organization. Three other contenders have been knocked out of the competition after failing to secure enough votes. It means five candidates remain in the race to be the next director-general. Mr Fox would be the first British boss of the organisation, which regulates the terms of international trade. Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted his congratulations to Mr Fox, saying the WTO \"would be in excellent hands under his leadership\". He has also won the support of his ministerial successor. Trade Secretary Liz Truss said she was \"delighted\" Mr Fox remains in the race. \"The world needs a WTO director general that will stand up for free trade and fight protectionism. Business as usual will not work. We need someone with political skill who can build consensus, get things done, and drive forward the urgent reform that is needed. \"Liam is the ideal candidate for that,\" said Ms Truss. The three candidates who left the race are Mexico's Jesus Seade, Egypt's Hamid Mamdouh and Moldova's Tudor Ulianovschi. The remaining candidates to replace the current director-general, the Brazilian Roberto Azevedo, have to secure support from the WTO's 164 member states. The members have said they want to reach a consensus in November. The contest comes at a crucial time for the Geneva-based body, amid a slump in global trade in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Fox is still an outsider in the race to be the next WTO chief, according to the latest odds from Ladbrokes, which has him in fourth place at 10/1. The other remaining candidates are: Mr Fox was the UK's international trade secretary under former prime minister Theresa May, when he was responsible for promoting UK trade post-Brexit. He was sacked when Mr Johnson entered Downing Street, having supported Mrs May's Brexit withdrawal deal, which Mr Johnson opposed. He has downplayed the importance of Brexit and did not mention it in his speech to the WTO's governing body in July. Asked whether ongoing trade talks between the UK and EU would prove an advantage or obstacle to his bid, he replied: \"Very fortunately, not everyone in the world sees every issue through the Brexit prism.\" Speaking after his hearing, Mr Fox said the WTO needed an experienced politician - rather than a \"technocrat\" - to help it navigate \"what is a very difficult time\"."

  "title": "Police launch homicide inquiry after German hospital hack - BBC News",
  "url": "https://www.bbc.com//news/technology-54204356",
  "related_topics": "Technology",
  "article_text": "German police have launched a homicide investigation after a woman died during a cyber-attack on a hospital. Hackers disabled computer systems at DÃ¼sseldorf University Hospital and the patient died while doctors attempted to transfer her to another hospital.   Cologne prosecutors officially launched a negligent homicide case this morning saying hackers could be blamed. One expert said, if confirmed, it would be the first known case of a life being lost as a result of a hack. The ransomware attack hit the hospital on the night of 9 September, scrambling data and making computer systems inoperable.  Such attacks are one of the most serious threats in cyber-security with dozens of high profile attacks so far this year. The attackers can demand large payments in cryptocurrency Bitcoin in exchange for a software key that unlocks IT systems.  The female patient, from DÃ¼sseldorf, was due to have scheduled life-saving treatment and was transferred to another hospital in Wuppertal which is roughly 19 miles (30km) away.  Some local reports suggest the hackers did not intend to attack the hospital and in fact were trying to target a different university. Once the hackers had realised their mistake it is reported they gave the hospital the decryption key without demanding payment before disappearing. Detectives have brought in cyber-security experts to ascertain whether there is a link between the hack and the patient's death, with the hospital also likely to be investigated. Germany's national cyber-security authority says it is on site at the hospital helping the hospital's IT staff rebuild systems. Its president Arne SchÃ¶nbohm said hackers took advantage of a well-known vulnerability in a piece of VPN (virtual private network) software developed by Citrix, and warned other organisations to protect themselves from the flaw. \"We warned of the vulnerability as early as January and pointed out the consequences of its exploitation. Attackers gain access to the internal networks and systems and can still paralyse them months later.  \"I can only stress that such warnings should not be ignored or postponed, but need appropriate measures immediately. The incident shows once again how seriously this risk must be taken.\"  Former chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre Ciaran Martin said: \"If confirmed, this tragedy would be the first known case of a death directly linked to a cyber-attack. It is not surprising that the cause of this is a ransomware attack by criminals rather than an attack by a nation state or terrorists.  \"Although the purpose of ransomware is to make money, it stops systems working. So if you attack a hospital, then things like this are likely to happen. There were a few near misses across Europe earlier in the year and this looks, sadly, like the worst might have come to pass.\" Last month, technology giant Garmin is understood to have paid hackers a multi-million pound sum after its IT and production systems were taken offline in a ransomware attack. Law enforcement agencies encourage victims not to pay ransoms arguing it fuels organised cyber-crime operations. "

  "related_topics": "World",
  "article_text": "The number of confirmed coronavirus cases across the globe has surpassed 30 million, according to figures by America's Johns Hopkins University. More than 940,000 have died with Covid-19 since the outbreak began in China late last year. The US, India and Brazil have the most confirmed cases, but there is a renewed spike in infections across Europe. Many northern hemisphere countries are now bracing for a second wave of the pandemic as winter approaches. In the UK, the government is considering taking further England-wide measures including a short period of restrictions to try to slow a second surge of infections. Outside Europe, Israel brings in a second nationwide lockdown later on Friday - the first nation to do so. Africa has recorded more than a million confirmed cases, although the true extent of the pandemic in the continent is not known. Testing rates are reported to be low, which could distort official figures. A team of infectious disease experts at Johns Hopkins University, in the US city of Baltimore, have been documenting the global spread of Covid-19 on its tracking website.  According to their data, the US remains by far the worst-hit country in terms of sheer numbers, with more than 6.6 million confirmed infections, and over 197,000 deaths. The number of new daily infections has been dropping, though, after a spike in July. Earlier this week, President Donald Trump denied downplaying the seriousness of Covid-19, despite admitting in a recorded interview to having done that. In India, the number of known infections climbed above five million this week - the second-highest caseload in the world.  When comparing figures from different countries it is important to bear in mind factors such as population size and density. For instance, India has a population of 1.3bn people.  However, the virus appears to be spreading much faster in India than any other country, with daily cases topping 90,000 in recent days. More than 80,000 people have died, amid reports of shortages of intensive care beds and oxygen supplies. Brazil has had more than 4.4 million confirmed cases, with more than 134,000 fatalities - the second-highest death toll after the US. President Jair Bolsonaro has come under criticism for downplaying coronavirus, particularly after attending an anti-lockdown rally. The right-wing leader - who had been calling the virus a \"little flu\" - himself tested positive in July. Argentina and Mexico have also been hit hard by the outbreak in Latin America.   Argentina on Thursday reported nearly 13,000 more cases over a 24-hour period, pushing the country's overall total above 600,000.  Meanwhile, Mexico confirmed more than 3,000 daily infections, bringing the caseload to more than 680,000. At the same time, deaths per 100,000 people vary significantly from country to country, with San Marino, Peru and Belgium having the highest rates, and India one of the lowest. In the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases. In the coloured bars on the right-hand side, countries in which cases have risen to more than 5,000 per day are those with black bars on the relevant date.

It has come under fire for being slow to acknowledge the outbreak, allowing gatherings to take place even as concerns grew and punishing doctors for warning others. It has since been praised for effectively slowing the spread of the virus, after imposing a massive lockdown and increasing hospital capacity. It has so far confirmed 90,000 cases and 4,700 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins, although there have been concerns of underreporting. Surging coronavirus figures on the continent should serve as \"a wake-up call\", the World Health Organization's regional director has said. Speaking in Copenhagen on Thursday, Hans Kluge said in the past two weeks the number of new cases had doubled in more than half of European member states. He said that 300,000 new infections were reported across Europe last week alone and weekly cases had exceeded those reported during the first peak in March. According to the WHO, there have been five million confirmed cases and more than 228,000 fatalities across Europe since the pandemic began. A number of countries and companies are piling resources into finding a vaccine that is safe and effective. President Trump has recently said a vaccine might be available before the 3 November presidential elections - despite warnings from a number of health experts that this is unrealistic.  Russia in August licensed a vaccine for local use - the first country to do so. Russian scientists later published the first report on the vaccine, saying early tests showed signs of an immune response. But experts warned that the trials were too small to prove effectiveness and safety. No vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, leading some scientists to fear politics rather than health and safety is driving the push for the possible cure. There are also concerns that the race to get a vaccine will be won by the richest countries, at the expense of the most vulnerable. At the same time, more than 150 different drugs are being researched to identify treatments for people with severe Covid-19. Of all the drugs being trialled, only steroids have been proven to save lives and the discovery has been a significant breakthrough. The UK's Recovery trial showed the steroid dexamethasone cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators and by a fifth for those on oxygen. And further data suggests another steroid, hydrocortisone, is equally effective too. "

The TV pundit, former footballer and ex-Strictly star also played down suggestions she was lined up to replace Sue Barker on the BBC One show.  Match Of The Day's Gary Lineker tweeted congratulations to Scott on the role on Thursday, but later deleted it. The BBC denied that any decision has been made over the new presenting team. The corporation said: \"No conversations have been had about the future line-up,\" However, newspaper reports during the week suggested Scott was being lined up to replace Barker, who is exiting the show after 24 years. It is part of a major shake-up of A Question of Sport by the BBC, which will also see team captains Matt Dawson and Phil Tufnell depart. After the rumours of Scott's appointment began circulating, the broadcaster received several abusive tweets from viewers unhappy with the changes. Many, however, leapt to her defence and congratulated her.  On Friday, Scott tweeted: \"The love and support shown to me yesterday has me smiling through the weekend #thankyou. I am going to #KeepOnKeepingOn like always!\" She added: \"The only thing that is signed sealed delivered that I am buzzing about right now though is Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at Arsenal,\" she said, referring to the team's captain signing a new deal on Tuesday. The broadcaster also shared an anti-racism poem she wrote in 2018 on her Instagram Story, with the line: \"Some want to say I'm ticking a box, but that's not me.\" The poem, written about herself, also said: \"I was that girl that played football, I didn't really care, \"I was that girl that played football, long brown hair. \"I was that girl that played football, with no regards to the colour of my skin, \"I was that girl that played football, because I always wanted to win.... \"Hi, hello, I'm Alex Scott  and you know what, football is me.\"  Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

  "title": "Climate change: Earthquake 'hack' reveals scale of ocean warming - BBC News",
  "url": "https://www.bbc.com//news/science-environment-54193334",
  "related_topics": "Science & Environment",
  "article_text": "Scientists have found a clever new way of measuring ocean warming, using sound waves from undersea earthquakes.  The researchers say the \"hack\" works because sound travels faster in warmer water. The team looked at sonic data from the Indian Ocean emitted by tremors over a 10-year period. As the seas have warmed due to global heating, the scientists have seen the sound waves increase in speed. Their new method shows the decadal warming trend in the Indian Ocean was far higher than previous estimates. Having accurate information on the warming of our oceans is critical for climate scientists. They understand that around 90% of the energy trapped in our atmosphere by greenhouse gases is absorbed by the seas. But having precise temperature measurements, in multiple locations and depths, is a huge challenge.  The deployment of around 4,000 autonomous devices called Argo floats that capture temperature information has helped enormously, but there are big gaps in our knowledge. This is especially true in relation to what's happening in the waters deeper than 2,000m.  But now a team of researchers has developed a very different approach that exploits the fact that the speed of sound in seawater depends on temperature. The idea was first proposed and trialled in the late 1970s using sound waves generated by scientists. However, concerns over the impact of these sounds on marine mammals and rising costs saw the idea abandoned. The new approach involves using the naturally produced sound waves that occur when an underwater earthquake strikes.  The scientists examined data from over 4,000 tremors that occurred in the Indian Ocean between 2004 and 2016.   The team then looked for pairs of \"repeaters\", earthquakes with almost identical origins and power.  By measuring how long these slow-moving signals took to travel across the waters from Indonesia to a monitoring station on the island of Diego Garcia, they were able to work out the changes in temperature for the whole of the ocean over the 10-year period.  \"It takes sound waves about half an hour to travel from Sumatra to Diego Garcia,\" lead author Dr Wenbo Wu from the California Institute of Technology told BBC News. \"The temperature change of the deep ocean between Sumatra and Diego Garcia causes this half-hour travel time to vary by a few tenths of a second. \"Because we can measure these variations very accurately, we can infer the small changes in the average temperature of the deep ocean, in this case about a tenth of a degree.\" The author says the system has some major advantages, as it is able to provide a large-scale average temperature along the 3,000km path from Sumatra to Diego Garcia, which reduces the influence of local fluctuations, essentially making it more accurate over the ocean as a whole.  The method is also quite cheap, as it uses data that's already being gathered, and is sensitive to temperatures deeper than the current restriction of 2,000m. In their research, the scientists showed that warming in the Indian Ocean over the decade that they studied was greater than previously estimated.  However, the paper has some important caveats. \"It is important to emphasise that this is a result that applies to this particular region and this particular decade,\" said Dr Wu. \"We need to apply our method in many more regions and over different time frames to evaluate whether there is any systematic under- or over-estimation of the deep-ocean trend globally. \"It is much too early to draw any conclusions in this direction.\" To make the idea work on a global scale, the scientists will need access to more underwater receivers. Right now, the research team is working with data collected by a hydrophone network operated by the United Nations Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization, which is listening for underwater nuclear explosions.  These hydrophones pick up signals from many of the 10,000 shallow submarine earthquakes that occur globally every year, explained Dr Wu. \"All this data contains information on the temperature change of the deep ocean — it is just waiting for us to extract it.\" The study has been published in the journal Science.

  "related_topics": "Technology",
  "article_text": "Tech firms have been urged to stop advertising to under-18s in an open letter signed by MPs, academics and children's-rights advocates. Behavioural advertising not only undermines privacy but puts \"susceptible\" youngsters under unfair marketing pressure, the letter says. It is addressed to Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. In a separate move Google-owned YouTube is accused of unlawfully mining data from five million under-13s in the UK. European data protection laws forbid the mining of data of young children. \"The fact that ad-tech companies hold 72 million data points on a child by the time they turn 13 shows the extent of disregard for these laws, and the extraordinary surveillance to which children are subjected,\" the letter reads. \"There is no justification for targeting teenagers with personalised ads any more than there is for targeting 12-year-olds. \"You, the most powerful companies on the internet, have a responsibility to protect your users.\"  Among the 23 signatories are MP Caroline Lucas and clinical psychologist Dr Elly Hanson. Friends of the Earth is also named on the letter.  It was co-ordinated by Global Action Plan, which argues that online advertising accelerates consumerism, and adds unnecessary pressure to the planet. All the firms involved have been asked to comment but none has yet responded. Separately, privacy advocate Duncan McCann is suing Google on behalf of five million British children, claiming it broke privacy laws by tracking children online, in breach of both UK and European data-protection laws. The case, lodged with the UK High Court in July, will be strongly contested by YouTube which will argue its platform is not for children aged under 13. Mr McCann, who has three children under that age, believes damages of between Â£100 and Â£500 could be payable to children who are found to have had their data breached."

  "url": "https://www.bbc.com//news/uk-54172210",
  "related_topics": "UK",
  "article_text": "Plans to put the NHS top of the list for coronavirus tests will be published in the coming days, the justice secretary has said. People in care homes would also be a priority, while schools could be considered, Robert Buckland said. Resolving delays with testing was \"the number one issue\", he added. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said each school was given 10 home-testing kits at the start of term and could now order more from today. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said the prime minister had \"time and again\" made pledges on testing but \"then breaks those promises\". Standing in for party leader Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs, she told the House of Commons: \"They've had six months to get this right and yet the prime minister still can't deliver on his promises. \"The health secretary said yesterday it would take weeks to sort this situation out. We don't have weeks.\" Mr Johnson defended the government's record, saying the UK had \"done more tests than any other European country\". He said it was trying to meet a \"colossal spike\" in demand at \"record speed\", adding that 89% of tests done in person were being returned the next day. Speaking earlier to BBC Breakfast, Mr Buckland said testing centres would be increasing from about 400 to 500 in the next few weeks. As well as prioritising tests for the NHS and then social care, he said schools were also important because of their \"knock-on effect to the working lives of parents and carers\".  Health Secretary Matt Hancock will announce who will be prioritised for tests in the next few days. A surge in demand for coronavirus tests has led to local shortages, with many people reporting problems securing online bookings and being directed to test sites hundreds of miles from home. The large Lighthouse laboratories, run by the government to analyse test swabs from all the UK nations, have been under strain to process them all. Test slots are limited because, while there seem to be enough testing sites, there are bottlenecks in labs for processing swabs, BBC health editor Hugh Pym said. A new lab is due to be up and running but that could be a few weeks away - and until then ministers say current problems are likely to continue. Bolton NHS Trust in Greater Manchester said that more than 100 people had turned up to accident and emergency on Tuesday asking for a test. Mr Hancock, speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, said rising demand for tests meant the government was \"having to prioritise once again and I do not shirk from decisions about prioritisation\".  Data on backlogs in labs is not publicly available, but Mr Hancock said it was \"less than a day's capacity\". That means it could be anywhere up to 244,000. The Department of Health has said about a quarter of people requesting tests have no need to do so - and only those with relevant symptoms should book. Some closed for a period days after reopening while others have told classes and whole year groups - many of which form one bubble  - to self-isolate for two weeks following confirmed cases. Teaching unions have called for the education sector to be prioritised for the allocation of tests to ensure schools remain open.  Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said if issues with testing capacity were not fixed keeping schools open would become \"unsustainable\". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme head teachers would have to decide whether a bubble stays at home if a pupil or teacher showed Covid-19 symptoms and could not get a test to prove they were negative. It would feel like lockdown \"by default\", he said, and be more frustrating for parents as it is unpredictable. The ASCL, along with two other unions representing head teachers and governors - NAHT and the National Governance Association - has written to the PM expressing concern over the delays, saying school leaders are in an \"impossible situation\". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs on Wednesday he had emphasised the importance of prioritising schools to Baroness Harding, head of the UK testing system. He said they had this morning opened a schools ordering system to access tests directly from the NHS.  Scott Vining's daughter fell ill with a temperature on Saturday. By Sunday, the rest of the family, who live near Dunstable, in Bedfordshire, had also developed symptoms. \"We've tried hundreds of times,\" he told the BBC about trying to book a test. \"We started to try and book tests for my daughter on Sunday, to no avail, and then we started at 08:00 on Monday morning for us all.\" At one point Scott was offered a test in Warwickshire, 65 miles away from his home, through the government website. But by the time he'd entered the details of his family of four, the spaces had disappeared. Maria Aziz, from west London, has been trying to book a test since Sunday, when her nine-year-old daughter, Mishal, complained of a sore throat. By 04:00 Monday, her daughter had developed a fever. She said she had spent three days trying and failing to book a test. Her eldest daughter, Eimann, 14, also had to be withdrawn from school while she tried to book a test for her younger daughter. \"I'm trying through the government website and then yesterday there was also a number on the website to call - 119 - so I tried that as well. Each time there were no tests available. No home kits. No walk-in slots. No drive-through slots. Nothing.\"   Around 220,000 tests are processed each day, according to government figures for Monday. The government said its UK laboratory daily testing capacity was more than 370,000 as of last week - which includes antibody tests and those tests used by scientists to estimate how widespread the virus is. Testing capacity (excluding antibody tests and virus spread testing) is about 245,000 a day. Government data shows that both testing capacity and laboratory capacity have increased considerably since the beginning of the pandemic, The aim is to increase capacity to 500,000 a day by the end of October. However, there has been a sizeable gap between how many tests labs are able to process (\"capacity\") and the number of tests actually processed.  Analysis from Our World In Data, a research team based at the University of Oxford, suggests the UK is now performing more tests than many other countries. For example, the seven-day average up until 10 September showed the UK had carried out 2.8 tests per 1,000 people. This was ahead of European countries including France (2.1) and Spain and Germany (both 1.8).    Have you had problems getting a coronavirus test?

  "article_text": "As coronavirus devastates the travel industry, whalers in Norway are reaping the rewards of a national staycation. \"For me whale meat is my childhood, my memories,\" says Frode Revke, as he sorts through a pile of white Norwegian cheese. \"Even my mother's spaghetti bolognese was whale meat. The first time I went to Italy I was so disappointed, it tasted of nothing!\" Frode runs Ost & Sant, a deli selling traditional food in the heart of Oslo. In an average year the place is heaving with foreign visitors. But 2020 has been a little different. \"This year it's been Norwegians who've come around,\" he says. \"People who can't travel or go to restaurants are staying home to cook, and that's changing what we sell.\" And what's selling is whale meat.  For the first time in years the industry is seeing a spike in demand. This summer, Norwegians who would usually have travelled to Italy and Spain have instead headed north to places in Norway like the Lofoten Islands. There you'll find sparkling fjords, jagged coastlines, and endless days of midnight sun. As well as a traditional type of food that's illegal in most countries around the world. By the mid-20th Century many species of whale had been driven close to extinction. And since the International Whaling Commission (IWC) announced a ban in 1986, only Norway, Iceland and Japan have continued the hunt on a large scale. Aboriginal communities in Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Russia also catch small numbers of whales, as does the Caribbean nation of St Vincent the Grenadines. Norway cites cultural reasons for flouting the 1986 ban, and maintains that - despite its reputation - whaling is a sustainable industry. In the words of Alessandro Astroza, a senior adviser at the Norwegian Ministry of Trade, the issue has become \"emotional\". He questions why whale meat is vilified above other sources of protein. After all, minke whales, the main species that Norway catches, are free range and not endangered, and the whaling industry produces none of the methane that the beef industry does.  But what does whale meat taste like? It is certainly distinctive. It's traditionally served fresh or smoked, and many Norwegians use the same word to describe it - \"tran\". There's no direct translation into English, but the closest you can get is \"that cod liver oil taste\". Combine that with a beef-like consistency, and an incredibly salty hit, and you've got whale. If you don't think that sounds particularly appetising, you're not alone.  Demand for the meat has been falling in Norway for years, and in 2019 the country saw its lowest annual catch in 20 years. A total of 429 minkes were killed, out of the more than 100,000 that live in the Norwegian and Barents seas. This year, that number has jumped, with almost 500 killed. According to local whalers, demand has outstripped supply for the first time in half a decade.   But why has demand risen? Oyvind Haram, from the Norwegian Seafood Federation, says it is more than just the impact of coronavirus. Instead he says that a campaign to make whale meat more attractive to foodies is paying off. \"To get attention you have to start early,\" he says. \"[Such as] working on social media in January, months before the whale season starts.\" For Oyvind whale is a distinctly local product that boasts low food miles, health benefits, and a sustainable and seasonable quota.  He's spearheading a strategy that pushes this eco-friendly message to younger consumers along with fresh whale recipes. Oyvind has also begun working with prominent Norwegian chefs. Jonathan Romano is a former sushi chef who presents the Norwegian version of MasterChef. Growing up in a Filipino household, he didn't eat whale meat as a child, and saw it as a relic of a bygone era. After meeting Oyvind at a whale food showcase his views changed.  \"The problem is you've traditionally eaten whale as part of a stew with heavy, creamy gravy,\" says Mr Romano. \"The meat gets really tough with a strong metallic taste. Instead, you should eat it perfectly fried, seared with a raw middle point.\"  He believes more chefs are likely to use it in the coming years. Like many traditional industries, whaling relies on family ties - sons who follow their fathers onto the high seas.  But dynasties don't last forever. In recent times recruitment has been non-existent, despite the possibility of earning 1.6 million krone (£140,000; $180,000) a year.  More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:  To encourage more people to go into whaling, the government has cut red tape around the industry. In what is a notoriously dangerous way to earn a living, it's now easier than ever to launch your own boat.  This comes as the global fall in the price of oil this year has made it much harder to find work on Norway's offshore rigs. The country has built its wealth on its vast crude reserves, but the oil industry has been badly affected. So could 2020 signify the start of a long-term revival for Norway's whaling sector? It is tough to say. Siri Martinsen, from the anti-whaling animal welfare group Noah, says younger consumers won't start eating whale meat.  She points to a study that suggests only 4% of Norwegians eat whale on a regular basis, and thinks this is unlikely to change. But Ole Myklebust says 2020 has been different. His company supplies more than 20% of the nation's whale meat, and operates Norway's only export route to Japan. At the Myklebust factory on the remote island of Haroya, 100kg steaks are wheeled in on crates. Knives the size of hockey sticks lean against the wall, and scraps of whale meat are turned into food for hungry sled dogs. Nothing is wasted. He says he is selling more to Norway's largest supermarket chain, and expects bigger contracts in 2021.  Back in Oslo, Frode Revke muses on the change in a deli frequented by hip young Norwegians. \"I'm selling cured whale tenderloin and warm smoked whale for making carpaccio,\" he says. \"But the whale sausage is the most popular. \"When I started selling it I thought, 'this is just a fun thing, a curiosity.' But within a few months it's became the most popular product in the whole shop.\""

  "article_text": "\"There is something you can't replace with an LED,\" says Eileen Peters. But she's not talking about the ambience in her home.  Mrs Peters is referring to the 176-year-old St John's Point lighthouse on the County Down coast in Northern Ireland - which is earmarked to have its old filament light source replaced with a more modern LED. She and fellow filament enthusiasts argue that, however subtle, any change to the light is an unacceptable assault on heritage. In recent years, lighthouse authorities in the UK and Ireland have been gradually upgrading the technology installed in lighthouses. Part of this work has involved switching filaments over to industrial-sized LEDs, which engineers say use less energy and are easier to maintain.  In most cases, hardly anyone has noticed the change. But in County Down, a battle has been brewing for five years. One set of proposals for changes to St John's Point has already been vetoed by the local council, following protests by campaigners. \"We just want to preserve a thing of beauty,\" says Mrs Peters, who refers to the fishermen and boat owners who sail from the nearby village harbours of Ardglass and Killough. \"They actually love that light. I'm not exaggerating - they feel very strongly about it.\"  Out of 65 lighthouses around the island of Ireland, there are just a handful left that have not been switched over to LEDs. One is St John's Point.  The lighthouse authority responsible for St John's Point is the Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL). Around the rest of the British Isles the two other main lighthouse authorities, Trinity House and the Northern Lighthouse Board, have also been carrying out upgrades.   More Technology of Business  Some 125 lighthouses and other structures in Scotland and the Isle of Man, out of a total of more than 350, have had LEDs fitted by the Northern Lighthouse Board. And about 20 out of 66 lighthouses around England, Wales, the Channel Islands and Gibraltar managed by Trinity House have been modernised so far, according to a spokesman. Two or three are completed every year, on average.  Engineers have tried to appeal to traditionalists to some degree. \"I relate to the locals who say that they want to make sure that the new solution looks and feels like their one,\" says Esko Sorva, product manager at Finnish firm Sabik Marine, one of a few companies that manufacture LEDs for lighthouses and similar structures. \"There's something magical and emotional about old lighthouses,\" he adds.  A research team working for Trinity House and two other lighthouse authorities developed a special LED unit for lighthouses, which is designed to slot into the old Fresnel lens enclosure, a 19th Century invention that creates a far-reaching beam.  The system is intended to replicate as closely as possible the colour and character of the old filament-based light source. The LED unit has huge fins to disperse heat from the high-powered LEDs at the centre of the structure and costs around €20,000 (£18,000; $24,000), depending on configuration, according to Sabik, one of two companies licensed to make and sell the LED units. The firm recently installed one of these devices in a traditional lighthouse in Helsinki. \"The locals didn't notice any difference,\" says Mr Sorva. The CIL's latest proposals for St John's Point, shortly to be filed, seek to retain the existing sweeping beam emitted by the lighthouse, says Robert McCabe, the authority's director of operations and navigational services.   The LED - like the one offered by Sabik - is now to be incorporated into a new rotating mechanism, preserving the beam, he says. Alas, for some campaigners, any alteration is anathema. They say the beam will not project as far out to sea and it will also probably have a slightly different colour and character in various weather conditions. \"It is a challenge still to convince those people,\" admits Capt McCabe. One reason for the LED installations is that the old filament light sources are becoming harder to repair and replace. But some lighthouse authorities are also seeking to rely more heavily on renewables, says Capt McCabe. The more efficient LEDs can be powered via solar panels, for instance, and use batteries, rather than diesel generators, as back-up power sources. But could the old technology not be kept in place at one or two lighthouses for the sake of local communities who want to preserve the light the way it is?  \"The small things do make a difference,\" insists Capt McCabe. \"Having our aids to navigation powered by renewable energy sources is a really strong message and we'd be really committed to it for that reason.\" Another key benefit of the new LED units is their length of service, says Paul Briggs, programme manager at Trinity House.  From 1,000 hours of operational use with an incandescent light, LEDs offer 50-100,000 hours instead, he explains. If and when LEDs are installed, Mr Briggs and his colleagues will also carry out a wider modernisation programme at the lighthouse in question - from improving power systems, installing solar panels or servicing mechanical structures in the building.  \"It is true that sometimes we'll upgrade a lighthouse and the characteristic of the light may change,\" he says.  However, the history of Trinity House stretches back more than half a millennium. For Mr Briggs, changes to lighthouses have come and gone as the tides - if not quite as frequently. \"You go back to when lighthouses were first thought of and you had a bonfire essentially on a stick and that was your light. \"LED technology is the next step, if you like, to providing what we think is the very best service… in terms of an aid to navigation for the mariner.\" Those opposed to the changes suggested by the CIL in County Down don't have any intention of backing down, however. Mrs Peters says she and her companions are keen to keep pressure on the local council in order to ensure St John's Point is left exactly as it is, without an LED in sight.  \"We're determined to win,\" she says."

  "article_text": "There have been more than 15,000 fires in Brazil's Pantanal wetlands so far this year, causing widespread devastation. That is triple the number recorded in the same period in 2019, according to data collected by Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (Inpe). A   shows the fires burning in the Pantanal, collected using satellites that measure blazes larger than 30m-long by 1m-wide. This article contains images some people may find upsetting. The wetlands is one of the world's most bio-diverse areas. In total 15,756 fires have been detected in the region so far this year, compared with 5,109 recorded in the same period last year. Brazil's National Centre for the Prevention of Forest Fires (Prevfogo) calculates that 2.9m hectares of the Pantanal have burned so far in 2020. A state of emergency has been declared in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul and Mato Grosso. Environment Minister Ricardo Salles says the fires have spread to \"gigantic proportions\".  Nevertheless, President Jair Bolsonaro said on Wednesday that the criticism levelled against his government over the fires in the Pantanal and also in the Amazon region had been \"disproportionate\".  The basin, which thrives off annual flooding following torrential rains, is home to jaguars, piranhas, capuchin monkeys, green anacondas and thousands of plant species. Forest fires often occur naturally in the dry season in Brazil but they are also deliberately started by ranchers trying to clear land for cattle. Experts say it is impossible to calculate yet how many animals have been killed by the fires, but losses are feared to be huge."

  "article_text": "Seaside swimmers, snowy landscapes and the aurora borealis are some of the contrasting local scenes captured by pairs of photographers working over 800 miles apart.  Professional and hobbyist photographers in Portobello, Edinburgh, and Akureyri, Iceland, connected online over their mutual seaside locations. Despite their distance, virtual pairs produced images on shared themes around their local areas. An outdoor exhibition of their work, Two Places at Sea, forms part of Edinburgh's Art Walk Porty 2020 festival. Here is a selection of some of the pairs' photographs, and their comments on their work.  Poppies by the Sea (DeplasÃ³lir viÃ° sjÃ³inn) - Jon Davey \"During the Scottish Covid-19 lockdown, I kept to a relatively strict pattern of activity, staying indoors except for twice-weekly visits to shops, even when the restrictions allowed outdoor exercise. \"I think the stress of shopping in those early days put me off from venturing out for any other reason. \"It was only as things eased further and we all became used to the 'new normal' that I resumed walks along the beach to Joppa and beyond.  \"This view from Joppa looking back towards Portobello and home after a longer walk to Musselburgh also represents my personal journey back to being the sort of person who walks along the beach where I live.\" KvÃ¶ldkyrrÃ° (In the Still of the Night)Â -Â Kristjana AgnarsdÃ³ttir \"One night I was strolling around my neighbourhood, which I think is the most beautiful part of Akureyri.  \"The old town by the pond. \"It is so peaceful in that area, enjoying the stillness and the birdlife, people walking, one or two cyclists, geese raising their young ones and the sun sinking into the sea in the north. \"It was waving goodnight to me on my way home.\"  Sunrise Swimmers (Synt viÃ° sÃ³larupprÃ¡s) - Anna Moffat \"I've lived in Portobello for 14 years andÂ often noticed small groups of swimmers out in all weathers. \"It was not until around a year agoÂ that I was persuaded to give it a go, and in an instant was hooked. \"The cold water hit is addictiveÂ and the feeling of togetherness enriches my life in so many ways - there's no better way to start the day.\" Vetrarbirta (Winter Light) -Â Lilja GuÃ°mundsdÃ³ttir \"There is not much going on at the beach during this time of the year, but sometimes we get visitors who make us happy and are fun to photograph. \"In the wintertime the daylight is often very beautiful, and occasionally the frost fog brings a fairy-tale glow to the environment.\"  Do Whatever Makes Your Heart Smile (GerÃ°u Ã¾aÃ° sem fÃ¦r hjarta Ã¾itt til aÃ° brosa) - Jennifer Elliot \"It was the light in the jasmine plant leaves that caught my eye while making dinner for the family, but this window gives me a lot of pleasure.  \"I've gathered friends and family there.  \"The purple plant was a gift from my French mum; the paper flower was made by my mum and daughter a few years back; the jasmine is a survival story; the glass jars a wedding gift from the Danish friend who introduced my husband and me; an Ocean Fire pot; the candles and other plants were gifts; the paint brushes drying - a result of my lockdown DIY frenzy; the crabs and scallop shell gathered by my son; my wedding rings on the window ledge; and all looking out to our own birch tree and wee walled garden.  ÃtsÃ½niÃ° Ãºr stofuglugganum (Living Room With a View)â - GuÃ°nÃ½ PÃ¡lÃ­na SÃ¦mundsdÃ³ttir \"I've lived in the same house, built by my parents when I was three years old, for most of my life.  \"I did move out when I met my husband and we lived in Norway for a while, but when moving back to Akureyri we bought the house from my mother (then a widow). â\"This photo, taken in January this year, shows the view from our living room window at sunset.  \"Having such a wonderful, ever-changing view is one of the reasons I'm not so keen on selling the house, even though it has become too big for us now that our children have left the nest.\"  From the Ground Up (FrÃ¡ jÃ¶rÃ°u til himins) - Tommy Black \"We both chose photographs taken from the beaches to the west of our respective communities, which we love for the sense of space.  \"My photo was taken one evening as lockdown started to ease, at 22:44.  \"It was one of those summer evenings that seems to go on forever.  \"A few folk were having fires just behind where the shot was taken.  \"There was a feeling of lightness as I walked out along the sand (tunes on, of course).\" FrÃ¡ jÃ¶rÃ°u til himins (From the Ground Up) - GuÃ°rÃºn KristÃ­n ValgeirsdÃ³ttir \"I chose this place because this is where I go to relax and gather my thoughts.   \"I take my dogs there, allow them to run free in playful games.  \"This is also my favourite spot to capture the auroras while they dance in the night sky in their most beautiful way.  \"I know few other things that are more fulfilling than to stand there with my camera and stare at those lights while they brighten up the cold dark winter sky.\"  Crossroads (KrossgÃ¶tur) - Adam Varga \"The west end of Portobello has been influential to the town, as the local industry and industrial landscape dominated the town's life, both socially and economically. \"The post-industrial changes brought new horizons into the life of the people of Portobello, as recently the Baileyfield area has been redeveloped with housing and expanded our community.  \"We are here to celebrate the new landscape and the people who will live in and transform this landscape.  \"My picture reflects on both the post-industrial transformation and serves as a memento in the history of the ever-changing west end of Portobello.\" Speglun (Reflection) - Berglind H HelgadÃ³ttir \"I have often stopped the car at this exact place close to Akureyri to take a picture over the fjord.  \"It has usually been at sunset during summer, when the sun shines golden or red light on the clouds and the sea.  \"This time it's not the redness in the sky that makes me step out of the car, but the light and the gloomy cloud that lies over part of the fjord.  \"Luck is with me because as soon as I have placed the tripod and adjusted the camera, the streetlights in the town turn on and the sea calms down.  \"I take a few pictures and observe the interplay of light and shadow as the dark cloud spreads.  \"Underneath it, the town looks a bit small and at the horizon you can see the mountain Kaldbakur bathing in the spotlight.\""

  "article_text": "Members of the public were invited to send pictures taken during the recent national lockdown for an online photography exhibition entitled Hold Still.  The images explore three themes: Helpers and Heroes, Your New Normal and Acts of Kindness.  The community project, led by the Duchess of Cambridge - patron of the National Portrait Gallery - received more than 31,000 entries. The final 100 images were selected by a panel of judges, including the duchess, Nicholas Cullinan, director of the National Portrait Gallery, writer and poet Lemn Sissay, Ruth May, chief nursing officer for England, and photographer Maryam Wahid. Here is a selection of those on show, alongside insights from the photographers:  \"Annemarie Plas is both the founder of Clap for our Carers and a Dutch yoga teacher living in south London. Inspired by a similar initiative in her homeland, she instigated the weekly clap on a Thursday night. It was to show appreciation for NHS workers and carers fighting the pandemic on the front line.  \"She told me her favourite part about the initiative was personally getting to know her neighbours, like many of us across the country.\"  \"We always want our residents at our dementia nursing home to know we are smiling under our masks.  \"We have had to learn new ways to communicate with our residents during the pandemic, as the mask is so restrictive and that comforting smile has been hidden. We all still smile and want it to be as visible as possible.\"  \"After trying to find an alternative solution, we took the difficult decision to isolate in different households to protect Mila, who, at this point, was only four months into her chemotherapy journey for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.   \"As Mila's dad, Scott, had to continue to work and her big sister, Jodi, had to attend school, we could not risk the possibility of infection being brought home - so they would visit every day at the window.  \"After seven weeks of temporary separation, and after being furloughed from his job, Scott was reunited with Mila. Looking back, I'm so proud of my daughter and how far she has come - the level of resilience Mila has shown during this unprecedented time is truly remarkable.\"  \"When it was announced church buildings were to be closed to the public to reduce the transmission of the virus, I wanted to assure our community that, although we couldn't gather physically, their photos in church were a symbol that they, and their loved ones, were still very much in our thoughts and prayers.\"  \"This is a studio portrait of Tendai, a recovery and anaesthetics nurse, who was born in Zimbabwe, and now lives in my local town - Reading, Berkshire.  \"I wanted to portray her caring side, as well as a look of concern and uncertainty that many of us have experienced during this pandemic. It's why I chose a lower than normal angle and asked her to look off-camera, placing her halfway down in the frame.\"  \"The Stockport Spider-Men was started by two friends, Jason Baird and Andrew Baldock, who took to the streets of Stockport right at the start of lockdown dressed as Spider-Man, and used their daily exercise time to keep the children smiling. This turned into a national phenomenon, with more than 50 members of the public, dressed as various other characters, joining in.  \"Jason also set up a JustGiving fund for the NHS Charities Together; in the four months of lockdown, he raised over Â£60,000 for the real superheroes - our wonderful NHS.\"  \"This was just before lockdown happened, when I took my son shopping. I happily got a big trolley and was surprised at how easy it was to get a parking space, only to find the superstore completely empty - only a few oils, spices, clothes and toys were left.  \"As a parent, I probably experienced silent panic, and a fear that this type of shopping would be the new normal. I decided to take the picture to remember a unique day that would be the start of a long and challenging time.\"  \"During lockdown, my mum had to become a primary school teacher for my brother. This moment captures one of the few times my brother was eager to do his homework. Through this photograph, I wanted to convey a warm feeling of when family is together.\"  \"This is Tony Hudgell, a five-year-old patient at Evelina London Children's Hospital. He walked a total of 10km throughout June on his new prosthetic legs, to thank the hospital that saved his life.  \"He had been learning to walk again. After seeing Captain Tom Moore on the news walking lengths of his garden, Tony said: 'I could do that', and he decided to set his own challenge. He set out to raise Â£500, but ultimately raised over Â£1.2 million for NHS charities.\"  \"My daughter, Sarah, is showing her house-bound grandfather the 12-week scan photograph of her first baby. She had the scan a few days earlier and drove to her grandparents' house so she could stand outside and show it to them.\"  \"We had to cancel our wedding because it was obvious it would have been impossible for it to have gone ahead. It didn't feel right, though, to not enjoy the day when it came around. So we dressed up with our children and celebrated together. It was a fun and memorable day and it kept a positive spin on what could have been viewed as a depressing situation.\"  \"My one-year-old little boy and his 88-year-old great grandma, who miss each other so much at the moment. I captured this beautiful moment between them whilst dropping off groceries. Kisses through glass.\" The Hold Still digital exhibition is available to view online at   from 14 September 2020. "
